    <p>‚ö° During Test Quick Checks Perform these essential 20-second micro-checks before bubbling any answer to prevent careless errors and maintain high accuracy throughout the contest.
üéØ The 20-Second Verification Rule Before Bubbling Any Answer: Plug back: Substitute answer into original problem Check units: Do the units and dimensions make sense? Verify constraints: Does answer satisfy all given conditions? Test extremes: Does answer work at boundary values? Check reasonableness: Is the answer in the right ballpark? üîç Quick Verification Techniques Plug-Back Check (5 seconds) Substitute answer: Replace variable with your answer Simplify: Work through the calculation Check equality: Does left side equal right side? Verify all conditions: Check all given constraints Confirm: Answer satisfies the problem Units &amp; Dimensions Check (3 seconds) Length: Should be positive, reasonable scale Area: Should be positive, units squared Volume: Should be positive, units cubed Probability: Must be between 0 and 1 Time: Should be positive, reasonable duration Constraint Verification (5 seconds) Domain restrictions: Does answer satisfy domain? Range restrictions: Does answer satisfy range? Inequality constraints: Does answer satisfy inequalities? Integer constraints: Is answer integer if required? Positive constraints: Is answer positive if required? Extreme Value Check (4 seconds) Boundary cases: Test at limits and extremes Special values: Test $x = 0, 1, -1$ if applicable Large values: Test with large numbers Small values: Test with small numbers Zero cases: Test when variables equal zero Reasonableness Check (3 seconds) Order of magnitude: Is answer too big or too small? Physical sense: Does answer make physical sense? Mathematical sense: Does answer make mathematical sense? Comparison: How does it compare to other answers? Intuition: Does it feel right? ‚ö° Problem-Specific Checks Algebra Problems Substitute back: Plug answer into original equation Check all solutions: Verify each root if multiple Test constraints: Check domain restrictions Verify signs: Check positive/negative requirements Check calculations: Verify arithmetic Geometry Problems Check dimensions: Verify units and scale Test angles: Are angles reasonable?

Number Theory Problems Check divisibility: Verify divisibility rules Test modular arithmetic: Check mod calculations Verify prime factors: Check prime factorizations Test digit properties: Check digit sum rules Check integer constraints: Is answer integer? Counting/Probability Problems Check range: Probability between 0 and 1 Verify counts: Are counts non-negative integers? Test symmetry: Check symmetric cases Verify formulas: Are you using the right formula? Check calculations: Verify arithmetic üö® Common Error Types Sign Errors Positive/negative: Is the sign correct? Addition/subtraction: Check your arithmetic Multiplication/division: Check your operations Exponents: Check positive/negative exponents Square roots: Check positive/negative roots Unit Errors Length units: Are units appropriate? Area units: Are units squared? Volume units: Are units cubed? Time units: Are units appropriate? Angle units: Degrees or radians?

    <p>üå≥ When Stuck Decision Tree Follow this systematic decision tree when you encounter difficult problems. Don‚Äôt waste time spinning your wheels - use this structured approach to find a solution or move on efficiently.
üéØ Initial Assessment (30 seconds) First, Ask Yourself: How long have I been on this problem? (If &gt; 5 minutes, consider moving on) Am I making progress? (If no progress, try different approach) Do I understand what‚Äôs being asked? (If not, re-read carefully) Is this problem worth my time? (Consider expected value) What‚Äôs my confidence level?

(If &gt; time limit, move on) Making progress? (If no, try different approach) Understand problem? (If not, re-read) Worth my time? (Consider expected value) Confidence level? (Low = try different approach) Recovery Actions: Switch tactics: Try different approach Use complement: Count what you don‚Äôt want Look for symmetry: Use symmetric properties Try backsolving: Use answer choices Use approximation: Estimate the answer Make educated guess: Use elimination and intuition Prev: During Test Quick Checks | Next: Final Review Pass | Back to: Strategy Guide
