    <p>📊 Estimation Sprints Master essential estimation and approximation techniques through focused practice drills. These exercises will build speed and accuracy in quick approximation and bounds calculations.
🎯 Core Estimation Skills Order of Magnitude Powers of 10: $10^0 = 1$, $10^1 = 10$, $10^2 = 100$, $10^3 = 1,000$ Scientific notation: $2.5 \times 10^3 = 2,500$ Quick estimates: $47 \times 23 \approx 50 \times 20 = 1,000$ (actual: 1,081) Magnitude checks: Is answer too big or too small? Rounding Strategies Round to nearest 10: $47 &#43; 38 \approx 50 &#43; 40 = 90$ (actual: 85) Round to nearest 100: $298 &#43; 156 \approx 300 &#43; 200 = 500$ (actual: 454) Round to nearest 1000: $1,234 &#43; 2,567 \approx 1,000 &#43; 3,000 = 4,000$ (actual: 3,801) Round to nearest power of 10: $47 \times 23 \approx 50 \times 20 = 1,000$ Approximation Techniques Linear approximation: $f(x) \approx f(a) &#43; f’(a)(x-a)$ Taylor series: Use first few terms Binomial approximation: $(1&#43;x)^n \approx 1 &#43; nx$ for small $x$ Exponential approximation: $e^x \approx 1 &#43; x$ for small $x$ ⚡ Quick Approximation Methods Common Approximations $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$ $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$ $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$ $\pi \approx 3.1416$ $e \approx 2.718$ $\ln 2 \approx 0.693$ $\ln 3 \approx 1.099$ Fraction Approximations $\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$ $\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$ $\frac{5}{8} = 0.625$ $\frac{7}{8} = 0.875$ $\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333$ $\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667$ Power Approximations $2^{10} \approx 1,000$ $3^4 = 81$ $5^3 = 125$ $7^2 = 49$ $2^{20} \approx 1,000,000$ 🎯 Practice Drills 5-Minute Sprint: Order of Magnitude Target: 20 problems in 5 minutes (90%&#43; accuracy)

    <p>📋 Error Log Template Use this systematic error tracking system to identify patterns, improve performance, and track progress over time. Consistent error logging is key to continuous improvement.
🎯 Error Taxonomy Careless Errors Calculation mistakes: Arithmetic errors, sign errors, order of operations Reading errors: Misreading problems, missing key details, misinterpreting Bubbling errors: Wrong answer choice, incomplete bubbles, stray marks Time pressure: Rushing, skipping steps, not verifying Conceptual Errors Misunderstanding: Not understanding what the problem is asking Wrong approach: Using incorrect method or strategy Missing knowledge: Not knowing required concepts or formulas Application errors: Misapplying known concepts or formulas Strategic Errors Time management: Spending too much time on one problem Guessing strategy: Poor guessing decisions or not guessing when should Problem selection: Choosing wrong problems to solve or skip Verification: Not checking work properly or at all 📊 Error Log Template Basic Information Date: When the error occurred Problem number: Which problem (if from practice test) Problem type: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Counting/Probability, Precalculus Difficulty level: Easy (1-10), Medium (11-20), Hard (21-25) Time spent: How long you spent on the problem Error Details Error category: Careless, Conceptual, or Strategic Specific error type: Choose from taxonomy above Description: Detailed description of what went wrong Correct approach: What you should have done instead Root cause: Why did this error occur? Analysis Pattern recognition: Is this a recurring error type? Prevention strategy: How can you prevent this error in the future? Practice needed: What specific practice would help? Confidence level: How confident were you in your approach? 🎯 Error Log Examples Example 1: Careless Error Date: 2024-01-15 Problem: #12 (Medium, Algebra) Error category: Careless Specific error type: Calculation mistake Description: Made arithmetic error in solving $2x &#43; 3 = 11$, wrote $2x = 14$ instead of $2x = 8$ Correct approach: Should have subtracted 3 from both sides: $2x = 8$, so $x = 4$ Root cause: Rushed through calculation without double-checking Pattern recognition: This is the 3rd arithmetic error this week Prevention strategy: Always double-check arithmetic, use plug-back verification Practice needed: More mental math practice, slower calculation Confidence level: High (knew the method, just made arithmetic error)

    <p>📊 Postmortem Framework Use this systematic framework to analyze your full test performance, identify trends, and develop targeted improvement strategies. Regular postmortem analysis is essential for continuous improvement.
🎯 Postmortem Process Immediate Analysis (Within 24 hours) Score calculation: Calculate your score and percentile Problem-by-problem review: Analyze each problem individually Error identification: Identify all mistakes and their causes Time analysis: Review time spent on each problem Strategy evaluation: Assess your overall approach Deep Analysis (Within 48 hours) Pattern identification: Look for recurring themes Strengths assessment: Identify what worked well Weaknesses analysis: Identify areas for improvement Strategy refinement: Adjust your approach Action planning: Develop specific improvement strategies 📋 Postmortem Checklist Test Performance Score: What was your final score? Percentile: What percentile did you achieve? Target comparison: How does this compare to your target? Previous performance: How does this compare to past tests? Overall assessment: How do you feel about your performance? Problem-by-Problem Analysis Problems 1-10: How many did you get correct? Problems 11-15: How many did you get correct? Problems 16-20: How many did you get correct? Problems 21-25: How many did you get correct? Accuracy by difficulty: What’s your accuracy by difficulty level? Error Analysis Total errors: How many problems did you get wrong? Error types: What types of errors did you make? Error patterns: Are there recurring error types? Error distribution: Where did most errors occur? Error causes: What caused these errors? Time Analysis Total time: How much time did you spend overall? Time per problem: What was your average time per problem? Time distribution: How did you allocate time across problems? Time pressure: Did you feel rushed at any point? Time management: How well did you manage your time? 🔍 Detailed Analysis Framework Problem-by-Problem Review For Each Problem: Problem number: Which problem was it? Difficulty level: Easy (1-10), Medium (11-20), Hard (21-25) Topic: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Counting/Probability, Precalculus Your approach: What method did you use? Time spent: How long did you spend on this problem? Result: Correct, incorrect, or skipped Error type: If incorrect, what type of error? Correct solution: What was the correct approach?
