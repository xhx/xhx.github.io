# üìê Diagramming and Estimation

Master visual problem-solving and estimation techniques to solve problems faster and more accurately.

## Quick Sketching Techniques

### Basic Drawing Tools
- **Pencil and paper** for rough sketches
- **Ruler** for straight lines and measurements
- **Protractor** for angle measurements
- **Compass** for circles and arcs

### Drawing Guidelines
- **Keep sketches simple** and clear
- **Label all given** information
- **Use standard notation** (points, lines, angles)
- **Draw to scale** when possible
- **Mark right angles** and parallel lines

### Common Shapes
- **Triangles**: Label vertices and sides
- **Quadrilaterals**: Mark parallel sides and right angles
- **Circles**: Label center, radius, and diameter
- **Coordinate planes**: Mark axes and scale

## Problem-Solving Diagrams

### Geometry Problems
**When to draw**:
- Angle relationships
- Area and perimeter calculations
- Similarity and congruence
- Coordinate geometry

**Drawing steps**:
1. **Read the problem** carefully
2. **Identify the shape** and given information
3. **Draw a rough sketch** with labels
4. **Mark all given** measurements and angles
5. **Use the diagram** to solve the problem

**Example**: Find the area of a triangle with base 6 and height 4.
```
    A
    |\
    | \
    |  \
    |   \
    |____\
    B    C
   base=6
```

### Word Problems
**When to draw**:
- Rate, time, distance problems
- Mixture problems
- Work problems
- Geometry word problems

**Drawing steps**:
1. **Identify the key** information
2. **Draw a diagram** representing the situation
3. **Label all given** values
4. **Use the diagram** to set up equations

**Example**: A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours. How far will it travel in 5 hours?
```
Distance = 120 miles
Time = 2 hours
Rate = 120/2 = 60 mph

In 5 hours: Distance = 60 √ó 5 = 300 miles
```

### Counting Problems
**When to draw**:
- Tree diagrams
- Venn diagrams
- Grid problems
- Path counting

**Drawing steps**:
1. **Identify the** counting structure
2. **Draw a systematic** diagram
3. **Count carefully** using the diagram
4. **Check for** overcounting or undercounting

## Estimation Strategies

### Rounding Techniques
**Whole numbers**:
- Round to the nearest 10, 100, or 1000
- Use compatible numbers for easier calculation
- Check reasonableness of results

**Decimals**:
- Round to one or two decimal places
- Use 0.5 as a benchmark for rounding
- Check if the result makes sense

**Fractions**:
- Round to common fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.)
- Use decimal equivalents for estimation
- Compare to known values

### Estimation Examples
**Arithmetic**:
- $47 + 23 \approx 50 + 20 = 70$ (actual: 70)
- $89 \times 12 \approx 90 \times 10 = 900$ (actual: 1068)
- $156 \div 4 \approx 160 \div 4 = 40$ (actual: 39)

**Geometry**:
- Area of circle with radius 7: $A \approx 3 \times 7^2 = 147$ (actual: 153.94)
- Perimeter of rectangle 8√ó12: $P \approx 2(10 + 10) = 40$ (actual: 40)

**Word problems**:
- If 3 apples cost $2, then 12 apples cost about $8
- If a car travels 60 mph for 2.5 hours, it goes about 150 miles

### When to Use Estimation
**Use estimation when**:
- Exact calculation is time-consuming
- Answer choices are far apart
- You need to check reasonableness
- Time is limited

**Don't use estimation when**:
- Answer choices are close together
- Exact answer is required
- You have plenty of time
- The problem is straightforward

## Visual Problem-Solving Process

### Step 1: Read and Understand
- **Read the problem** carefully
- **Identify what's given** and what's asked
- **Look for key words** and relationships
- **Determine the type** of problem

### Step 2: Plan Your Approach
- **Decide if a diagram** will help
- **Choose the best** visualization method
- **Plan your drawing** strategy
- **Consider estimation** if appropriate

### Step 3: Create the Diagram
- **Draw a clear** and accurate sketch
- **Label all given** information
- **Use standard notation** and symbols
- **Make it large enough** to work with

### Step 4: Solve Using the Diagram
- **Use the diagram** to identify relationships
- **Apply appropriate** formulas or methods
- **Show your work** clearly
- **Check your answer** against the diagram

### Step 5: Verify Your Answer
- **Check that your answer** makes sense
- **Verify units** and measurements
- **Compare to your** estimation
- **Look for alternative** solution methods

## Common Diagram Types

### Geometry Diagrams
- **Triangles**: Show sides, angles, and heights
- **Quadrilaterals**: Mark parallel sides and diagonals
- **Circles**: Show center, radius, and chords
- **Coordinate planes**: Plot points and lines

### Word Problem Diagrams
- **Rate-time-distance**: Show movement and time
- **Mixture problems**: Show containers and amounts
- **Work problems**: Show workers and time
- **Age problems**: Show relationships over time

### Counting Diagrams
- **Tree diagrams**: Show choices and outcomes
- **Venn diagrams**: Show set relationships
- **Grid diagrams**: Show paths and arrangements
- **Flow charts**: Show processes and decisions

## Estimation Techniques

### Front-End Estimation
**Method**: Use the first digit of each number
**Example**: $347 + 256 \approx 300 + 200 = 500$

### Compatible Numbers
**Method**: Use numbers that are easy to work with
**Example**: $47 \times 12 \approx 50 \times 10 = 500$

### Benchmark Estimation
**Method**: Use known reference points
**Example**: $0.47 \approx 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$

### Range Estimation
**Method**: Find upper and lower bounds
**Example**: $23 \times 47$ is between $20 \times 40 = 800$ and $30 \times 50 = 1500$

## Practice Exercises
