# ðŸ“Š Error Log Template

Track your mistakes systematically to identify patterns and improve your performance.

## Error Categories

### Careless Errors
**Definition**: Mistakes made due to inattention or rushing
**Examples**:
- Arithmetic mistakes (2+3=6)
- Copying errors (writing 47 instead of 74)
- Sign errors (forgetting negative signs)
- Unit conversion mistakes

**Prevention**:
- Slow down and double-check arithmetic
- Read problems carefully
- Show work clearly
- Check answers for reasonableness

### Misreading Errors
**Definition**: Misunderstanding what the problem is asking
**Examples**:
- Reading "greater than" as "less than"
- Missing key words like "not" or "except"
- Confusing similar terms (area vs. perimeter)
- Misinterpreting diagrams

**Prevention**:
- Read problems twice before solving
- Underline key words and phrases
- Draw diagrams when helpful
- Check that your answer makes sense

### Concept Errors
**Definition**: Not understanding the underlying mathematical concept
**Examples**:
- Using wrong formula
- Misapplying a rule or theorem
- Not recognizing problem type
- Confusing similar concepts

**Prevention**:
- Review concepts regularly
- Practice with different problem types
- Ask for help when confused
- Study worked examples

### Setup Errors
**Definition**: Correctly understanding the problem but setting it up incorrectly
**Examples**:
- Writing wrong equation
- Using wrong variables
- Incorrectly translating word problem to algebra
- Wrong diagram or visualization

**Prevention**:
- Practice problem setup
- Use systematic approaches
- Check setup before solving
- Practice with similar problems

### Time Errors
**Definition**: Running out of time or spending too much time on one problem
**Examples**:
- Not finishing the test
- Rushing through problems
- Getting stuck on difficult problems
- Poor time management

**Prevention**:
- Practice with time limits
- Use pacing strategies
- Skip difficult problems initially
- Practice mental math

## Error Log Template

### Basic Information
- **Date**: When the error occurred
- **Problem**: Description or problem number
- **Round**: Sprint, Target, Team, or Countdown
- **Time Spent**: How long you spent on the problem

### Error Analysis
- **Category**: Careless, Misreading, Concept, Setup, or Time
- **Description**: What went wrong
- **Correct Answer**: What the answer should be
- **Your Answer**: What you wrote (if different)

### Learning Plan
- **Root Cause**: Why the error occurred
- **Prevention Strategy**: How to avoid this error
- **Practice Needed**: What to practice more
- **Follow-up**: When to review this error

### Example Entry
```
Date: 2024-01-15
Problem: Find the area of a triangle with base 8 and height 6
Round: Sprint
Time Spent: 2 minutes

Category: Careless
Description: Used wrong formula - calculated perimeter instead of area
Correct Answer: 24
Your Answer: 28

Root Cause: Rushed through problem, didn't read carefully
Prevention Strategy: Always identify what's being asked before solving
Practice Needed: Review area formulas, practice with time pressure
Follow-up: Review in 1 week
```

## Weekly Review Process

### Step 1: Collect Errors
- **Gather all errors** from the week
- **Categorize each error** using the template
- **Identify patterns** in error types
- **Count frequency** of each category

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns
- **Most common error type**: Focus improvement efforts here
- **Problem areas**: Topics or skills needing work
- **Time management issues**: Pacing and strategy problems
- **Concept gaps**: Areas needing more study

### Step 3: Create Action Plan
- **Target specific errors** for improvement
- **Plan practice sessions** to address weaknesses
- **Set goals** for the next week
- **Schedule review** of previous errors

### Step 4: Track Progress
- **Monitor error frequency** over time
- **Celebrate improvements** in problem areas
- **Adjust strategies** based on results
- **Update goals** as needed

## Error Prevention Strategies

### For Careless Errors
- **Slow down** and read carefully
- **Double-check arithmetic** step by step
- **Use estimation** to verify answers
- **Show work clearly** to avoid copying errors

### For Misreading Errors
- **Read problems twice** before solving
- **Underline key words** and phrases
- **Draw diagrams** when helpful
- **Check that answer** makes sense

### For Concept Errors
- **Review concepts** regularly
- **Practice with different** problem types
- **Ask for help** when confused
- **Study worked examples** carefully

### For Setup Errors
- **Practice problem setup** systematically
- **Use standard approaches** for each problem type
- **Check setup** before solving
- **Practice translating** word problems to algebra

### For Time Errors
- **Practice with time limits** regularly
- **Use pacing strategies** effectively
- **Skip difficult problems** initially
- **Practice mental math** for speed

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Metrics
- **Total errors**: Count all errors made
- **Error rate**: Errors per problem attempted
