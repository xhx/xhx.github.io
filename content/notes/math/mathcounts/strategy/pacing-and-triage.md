# ⏱️ Pacing and Triage

Master time management to maximize your score across all MATHCOUNTS rounds.

## The Three-Pass System

### First Pass: Quick Wins (40% of time)
**Goal**: Answer easy problems quickly and accurately

**Strategy**:
- Scan all problems quickly
- Identify problems you can solve in 30 seconds or less
- Answer these problems immediately
- Don't get stuck on any single problem

**Problem Types to Target**:
- Basic arithmetic
- Simple algebra
- Obvious geometry
- Pattern recognition
- Mental math problems

### Second Pass: Medium Difficulty (50% of time)
**Goal**: Work on problems that require moderate effort

**Strategy**:
- Focus on problems you understand but need time to solve
- Use systematic problem-solving approaches
- Show clear work for complex calculations
- Check answers before moving on

**Problem Types to Target**:
- Multi-step word problems
- Coordinate geometry
- Number theory
- Counting problems
- Probability calculations

### Third Pass: Difficult Problems (10% of time)
**Goal**: Attempt remaining problems or make educated guesses

**Strategy**:
- Work on problems you haven't attempted
- Use estimation and approximation
- Make educated guesses when appropriate
- Don't leave problems blank

**Problem Types to Target**:
- Complex geometry
- Advanced algebra
- Challenging number theory
- Multi-step counting
- Any remaining problems

## Round-Specific Pacing

### Sprint Round Pacing
**Total Time**: 40 minutes for 30 problems
**Target**: 1.33 minutes per problem

**Time Allocation**:
- **First Pass** (15 minutes): 15 easy problems
- **Second Pass** (20 minutes): 10 medium problems
- **Third Pass** (5 minutes): 5 difficult problems or guesses

**Key Strategies**:
- Skip problems that take more than 2 minutes
- Use mental math whenever possible
- Don't show work unless necessary
- Make educated guesses on remaining problems

### Target Round Pacing
**Total Time**: 24 minutes for 8 problems
**Target**: 3 minutes per problem

**Time Allocation**:
- **First Pass** (8 minutes): 3 easy problems
- **Second Pass** (12 minutes): 4 medium problems
- **Third Pass** (4 minutes): 1 difficult problem

**Key Strategies**:
- Use calculator effectively
- Show clear work for partial credit
- Check answers carefully
- Don't rush - accuracy is more important than speed

### Team Round Pacing
**Total Time**: 20 minutes for 10 problems
**Target**: 2 minutes per problem

**Time Allocation**:
- **Planning** (2 minutes): Assign problems to team members
- **Working** (15 minutes): Solve assigned problems
- **Checking** (3 minutes): Review and verify answers

**Key Strategies**:
- Divide problems based on strengths
- Communicate clearly with teammates
- Check each other's work
- Collaborate on difficult problems

## Problem Triage System

### Level 1: Immediate (0-30 seconds)
**Characteristics**:
- Single-step problems
- Basic arithmetic
- Obvious pattern recognition
- Simple substitution

**Examples**:
- $2 + 3 = ?$
- What is $5^2$?
- Find the next term: $2, 4, 6, 8, ?$
- Evaluate $3x$ when $x = 4$

### Level 2: Quick (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
**Characteristics**:
- Two to three steps
- Basic algebra
- Simple geometry
- Pattern completion

**Examples**:
- Solve $2x + 5 = 13$
- Find the area of a rectangle with length 6 and width 4
- What is $15\%$ of 80?
- Find the next two terms: $1, 3, 9, 27, ?$

### Level 3: Moderate (2-5 minutes)
**Characteristics**:
- Multiple steps
- Word problems
- Coordinate geometry
- Number theory

**Examples**:
- A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours. How far will it travel in 5 hours?
- Find the distance between points $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$
- What is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 36?
- How many ways can 3 people sit in 5 chairs?

### Level 4: Difficult (5+ minutes)
**Characteristics**:
- Complex multi-step problems
- Advanced concepts
- Multiple solution paths
- High computational requirements

**Examples**:
- Find the area of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(4,0)$, and $(2,3)$
- How many positive integers less than 100 are divisible by 3 or 5?
- Solve the system: $x + y = 10$, $2x - y = 5$
- Find the sum of the first 20 terms of the arithmetic sequence $3, 7, 11, 15, \ldots$

## Time Management Tips

### Before Starting
- **Read all problems** quickly to assess difficulty
- **Identify your strengths** and target those problems first
- **Set time limits** for each pass
- **Prepare your workspace** (calculator, scratch paper, etc.)

### During the Round
- **Stick to your plan** - don't deviate unless necessary
- **Use a timer** to track your progress
- **Skip problems** that take too long
- **Make educated guesses** rather than leaving problems blank

### When Stuck
- **Move on** after 2-3 minutes on a problem
- **Try a different approach** if you have time
- **Use estimation** to narrow down answer choices
- **Make an educated guess** based on partial work

## Common Time Wasters

### Avoid These Mistakes
- **Getting stuck** on one difficult problem
- **Overthinking** simple problems
- **Showing unnecessary work** in Sprint round
- **Not using calculator** effectively in Target round
- **Arguing with teammates** in Team round
- **Second-guessing** yourself in Countdown round

### Time-Saving Techniques
- **Use mental math** for basic calculations
- **Estimate** when exact answers aren't needed
- **Recognize patterns** quickly
- **Use calculator shortcuts** effectively
- **Skip steps** that are obvious to you
- **Make educated guesses** when appropriate

## Practice Strategies

### Speed Drills
- **Time yourself** on individual problems
- **Practice mental math** daily
- **Work on pattern recognition** exercises
- **Use estimation** techniques regularly

### Full-Length Practice
- **Take practice tests** under timed conditions
- **Simulate competition** environment
- **Practice pacing** strategies
- **Review time allocation** after each test

### Targeted Practice
- **Focus on weak areas** that slow you down
- **Practice problem triage** with mixed difficulty sets
- **Work on speed** for your strong areas
- **Practice guessing** strategies for difficult problems
