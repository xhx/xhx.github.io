# üìê Coordinate Geometry Formulas

## üéØ Essential Formulas

### **Distance Formula**
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$

**Usage**: Find distance between any two points
**Micro-example**: Distance from $(0,0)$ to $(3,4)$ is $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$

### **Midpoint Formula**
$$M = \left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$

**Usage**: Find midpoint of a line segment
**Micro-example**: Midpoint of $(2,6)$ and $(8,4)$ is $\left(\frac{2+8}{2}, \frac{6+4}{2}\right) = (5,5)$

### **Slope Formula**
$$m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

**Usage**: Find slope of line through two points
**Micro-example**: Slope through $(1,3)$ and $(4,9)$ is $\frac{9-3}{4-1} = 2$

### **Point-Slope Form**
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

**Usage**: Write equation of line given point and slope
**Micro-example**: Line through $(2,5)$ with slope $3$: $y - 5 = 3(x - 2)$

### **Slope-Intercept Form**
$$y = mx + b$$

**Usage**: Write equation of line given slope and y-intercept
**Micro-example**: Line with slope $2$ and y-intercept $-1$: $y = 2x - 1$

### **Circle Standard Form**
$$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$

**Usage**: Write equation of circle given center and radius
**Micro-example**: Circle with center $(2,-3)$ and radius $5$: $(x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 25$

### **Circle General Form**
$$x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$

**Usage**: Convert to standard form by completing the square
**Micro-example**: $x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y - 3 = 0$ becomes $(x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 16$

## üîó Relationship Formulas

### **Parallel Lines**
$$m_1 = m_2$$

**Usage**: Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope
**Micro-example**: $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = 2x - 5$ are parallel

### **Perpendicular Lines**
$$m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$$

**Usage**: Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals
**Micro-example**: $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ are perpendicular

## üé® Transformation Formulas

### **Translation**
$$(x,y) \to (x+h, y+k)$$

**Usage**: Move point $h$ units right, $k$ units up
**Micro-example**: $(3,4)$ translated by $(2,-1)$ becomes $(5,3)$

### **Reflection Over X-Axis**
$$(x,y) \to (x,-y)$$

**Usage**: Flip point over x-axis
**Micro-example**: $(3,4)$ reflected over x-axis becomes $(3,-4)$

### **Reflection Over Y-Axis**
$$(x,y) \to (-x,y)$$

**Usage**: Flip point over y-axis
**Micro-example**: $(3,4)$ reflected over y-axis becomes $(-3,4)$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Distance formula**: Don't forget to square the differences
- **Midpoint formula**: Average the coordinates, don't add them
- **Slope formula**: Rise over run, not run over rise
- **Circle completing square**: Add to both sides of equation
- **Transformations**: Draw a sketch to verify direction
