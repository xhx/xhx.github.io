# 📊 Data and Statistics Reference

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### **Data Set**
A collection of numbers or values that we want to analyze.

### **Measures of Center**
Numbers that describe where the "middle" of the data is located.

### **Measures of Spread**
Numbers that describe how spread out the data is.

### **Probability**
The likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

## 📐 Measures of Center

### **Mean (Average)**
$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}$$

**Usage**: Find the average of a set of numbers
**Example**: Mean of 2, 4, 6, 8 is $\frac{2+4+6+8}{4} = 5$

### **Median**
The middle value when data is arranged in order.

**Usage**: Find the middle value of a data set
**Example**: Median of 1, 3, 7, 9, 12 is 7 (middle value)

### **Mode**
The value that appears most frequently in the data set.

**Usage**: Find the most common value
**Example**: Mode of 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 is 3 (appears twice)

## 📏 Measures of Spread

### **Range**
$$\text{Range} = \text{Maximum value} - \text{Minimum value}$$

**Usage**: Find how spread out the data is
**Example**: Range of 2, 5, 8, 12 is $12 - 2 = 10$

### **Standard Deviation**
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$$

**Usage**: Measure how spread out data is from the mean
**Note**: Usually calculated with calculator for MATHCOUNTS

## 🎲 Probability Basics

### **Basic Probability**
$$P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$

**Usage**: Find probability of a simple event
**Example**: Probability of rolling a 3 on a die is $\frac{1}{6}$

### **Complementary Events**
$$P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(\text{A})$$

**Usage**: Find probability of the opposite event
**Example**: If $P(\text{rain}) = 0.3$, then $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$

## 📊 Data Representations

### **Frequency Table**
Shows how often each value appears in the data.

### **Histogram**
A bar graph showing the distribution of data.

### **Box Plot**
Shows median, quartiles, and outliers in the data.

### **Scatter Plot**
Shows relationship between two variables.

## 💡 Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Identify what you're looking for** (mean, median, mode, etc.)
2. **Organize the data** in order if needed
3. **Use the appropriate formula** or method
4. **Check your answer** with estimation
5. **Consider outliers** and their effects

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- **Confusing mean and median** in calculations
- **Forgetting to order data** before finding median
- **Miscounting outcomes** in probability
- **Missing the complement** in probability problems
- **Wrong units** in calculations
