# üéØ Data and Statistics Problem Types

## üìä Problem Pattern Catalog

### **Type 1: Finding Measures of Center**
**Pattern**: Calculate mean, median, or mode of a data set
**Key Formula**: Mean = sum/count, Median = middle value, Mode = most frequent

**Worked Example**:
> Find the mean, median, and mode of: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10
> 
> **Solution**:
> **Mean**: $\frac{2+4+4+6+8+10+10+10}{8} = \frac{54}{8} = 6.75$
> 
> **Median**: Data is already ordered. With 8 values, median is average of 4th and 5th: $\frac{6+8}{2} = 7$
> 
> **Mode**: 10 appears most frequently (3 times)

### **Type 2: Weighted Averages**
**Pattern**: Find average when different values have different weights
**Key Formula**: $\frac{\sum(w_i \cdot x_i)}{\sum w_i}$

**Worked Example**:
> A student's grades are: Test 1 (80, weight 2), Test 2 (90, weight 3), Final (85, weight 5). Find the weighted average.
> 
> **Solution**:
> Weighted average = $\frac{2 \cdot 80 + 3 \cdot 90 + 5 \cdot 85}{2 + 3 + 5} = \frac{160 + 270 + 425}{10} = \frac{855}{10} = 85.5$

### **Type 3: Probability Calculations**
**Pattern**: Find probability of simple events
**Key Formula**: $P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$

**Worked Example**:
> A bag contains 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. What's the probability of drawing a red marble?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Total marbles = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
> Favorable outcomes = 3 (red marbles)
> Probability = $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$

### **Type 4: Complementary Probability**
**Pattern**: Find probability of the opposite event
**Key Formula**: $P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(\text{A})$

**Worked Example**:
> The probability of rain tomorrow is 0.3. What's the probability of no rain?
> 
> **Solution**:
> $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - P(\text{rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$

### **Type 5: Range and Spread**
**Pattern**: Find range or analyze how spread out data is
**Key Formula**: Range = Maximum - Minimum

**Worked Example**:
> Find the range of: 15, 22, 18, 25, 20, 19
> 
> **Solution**:
> Maximum = 25, Minimum = 15
> Range = 25 - 15 = 10

## üîç Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify what measure** you need to find
2. **Organize the data** if necessary
3. **Use the appropriate formula** or method
4. **Check your calculation** with estimation
5. **Consider the context** of the problem

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Not ordering data** before finding median
- **Forgetting to divide by total weight** in weighted averages
- **Miscounting outcomes** in probability
- **Confusing mean and median** in calculations
- **Missing the complement** in probability problems
