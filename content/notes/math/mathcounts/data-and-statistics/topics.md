# ðŸ“Š Data and Statistics Topics

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Subtopics

### **Measures of Center**
- **Mean**: Average of all values
- **Median**: Middle value when ordered
- **Mode**: Most frequent value
- **Micro-example**: Data set 2, 3, 3, 5, 7 has mean 4, median 3, mode 3
- **Trap**: Forgetting to order data before finding median

### **Measures of Spread**
- **Range**: Maximum - Minimum
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of spread from mean
- **Micro-example**: Data set 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 has range 8, mean 5
- **Trap**: Confusing range with mean

### **Weighted Averages**
- **Weighted Mean**: $\frac{\sum(w_i \cdot x_i)}{\sum w_i}$
- **Grade Point Average**: Common application
- **Micro-example**: Test scores 80, 90 with weights 2, 3: $\frac{2 \cdot 80 + 3 \cdot 90}{2 + 3} = \frac{430}{5} = 86$
- **Trap**: Forgetting to divide by total weight

### **Probability Basics**
- **Simple Probability**: Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes
- **Complementary Events**: $P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(\text{A})$
- **Micro-example**: Probability of not rolling a 6 is $1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$
- **Trap**: Confusing favorable and total outcomes

### **Data Representations**
- **Frequency Tables**: Count of each value
- **Histograms**: Bar graph of data distribution
- **Box Plots**: Shows quartiles and outliers
- **Micro-example**: Data 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 has frequency table: 1 appears 2 times, 2 appears 1 time, 3 appears 3 times
- **Trap**: Miscounting frequencies

### **Outliers and Their Effects**
- **Outlier**: Value far from other data points
- **Effect on Mean**: Outliers pull mean toward them
- **Effect on Median**: Median is less affected by outliers
- **Micro-example**: Data 1, 2, 3, 4, 100 has mean 22, median 3
- **Trap**: Not recognizing outliers

## ðŸš¨ Common Traps

1. **Median Ordering**: Forgetting to order data before finding median
2. **Weighted Average**: Not dividing by total weight
3. **Probability Counting**: Miscounting favorable outcomes
4. **Outlier Effects**: Not considering how outliers affect measures
5. **Unit Confusion**: Mixing different units in calculations

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

- **Median**: Always order data first
- **Mean**: Sum all values, then divide by count
- **Mode**: Find the most frequent value
- **Probability**: Count carefully, check your work
- **Outliers**: Consider their effect on your answer
