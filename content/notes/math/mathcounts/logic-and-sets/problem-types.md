# üéØ Logic and Sets Problem Types

## üìä Problem Pattern Catalog

### **Type 1: Basic Set Operations**
**Pattern**: Find union, intersection, or complement of sets
**Key Concept**: Use set operation definitions

**Worked Example**:
> If $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$, find $A \cup B$ and $A \cap B$.
> 
> **Solution**:
> $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ (all elements from both sets)
> 
> $A \cap B = \{3, 4\}$ (elements common to both sets)

### **Type 2: Venn Diagram Problems**
**Pattern**: Use Venn diagrams to solve counting problems
**Key Concept**: Each region represents a specific combination

**Worked Example**:
> In a class of 30 students, 18 like math, 15 like science, and 8 like both. How many like neither?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Draw a Venn diagram with two circles (Math and Science).
> 
> - Math only: $18 - 8 = 10$
> - Science only: $15 - 8 = 7$
> - Both: $8$
> - Neither: $30 - (10 + 7 + 8) = 5$

### **Type 3: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**
**Pattern**: Count elements in union of sets
**Key Formula**: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

**Worked Example**:
> A survey of 100 people found that 60 like pizza, 40 like burgers, and 20 like both. How many like at least one?
> 
> **Solution**:
> $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 60 + 40 - 20 = 80$
> 
> So 80 people like at least one food.

### **Type 4: Three-Set Problems**
**Pattern**: Use three-set Venn diagrams and inclusion-exclusion
**Key Formula**: $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$

**Worked Example**:
> In a class, 20 students like math, 18 like science, 15 like history, 8 like math and science, 6 like math and history, 5 like science and history, and 3 like all three. How many like at least one subject?
> 
> **Solution**:
> $|A \cup B \cup C| = 20 + 18 + 15 - 8 - 6 - 5 + 3 = 37$
> 
> So 37 students like at least one subject.

### **Type 5: Logical Statement Analysis**
**Pattern**: Analyze truth values of logical statements
**Key Concept**: Use truth tables or logical reasoning

**Worked Example**:
> If "All birds can fly" is false, what can we conclude about "Some birds cannot fly"?
> 
> **Solution**:
> If "All birds can fly" is false, then there exists at least one bird that cannot fly.
> 
> Therefore, "Some birds cannot fly" is true.

## üîç Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Draw a Venn diagram** if dealing with sets
2. **Identify what you know** about each set or region
3. **Use inclusion-exclusion** for counting problems
4. **Check all regions** in your diagram
5. **Verify your answer** makes sense

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting to subtract intersections** in inclusion-exclusion
- **Double-counting elements** in Venn diagrams
- **Missing regions** in complex diagrams
- **Confusing union and intersection** symbols
- **Not considering the universal set** in complement problems
