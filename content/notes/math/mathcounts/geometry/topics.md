# 📐 Geometry — Topics

Master the core topics and techniques for working with geometry in MATHCOUNTS.

## Triangle Properties

### Angle Sum Property
**Method**: Sum of angles in any triangle is 180°
**Example**: If two angles are 60° and 80°, the third angle is 180° - 60° - 80° = 40°

**Pitfall**: Forgetting that sum is always 180°
**Fix**: Always remember that angles in triangle sum to 180°

### Triangle Inequality
**Method**: Sum of any two sides must be greater than third side
**Example**: Can sides 3, 4, 8 form a triangle? 3 + 4 = 7 < 8, so no

**Pitfall**: Not checking all three combinations
**Fix**: Always check all three combinations of sides

### Pythagorean Theorem
**Method**: In right triangle, a² + b² = c² where c is hypotenuse
**Example**: If legs are 3 and 4, hypotenuse is √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5

**Pitfall**: Forgetting which side is hypotenuse
**Fix**: Hypotenuse is always the longest side, opposite the right angle

### Special Right Triangles
**30°-60°-90°**: Sides in ratio 1 : √3 : 2
**45°-45°-90°**: Sides in ratio 1 : 1 : √2
**3-4-5**: Sides in ratio 3 : 4 : 5
**5-12-13**: Sides in ratio 5 : 12 : 13

**Example**: In 30°-60°-90° triangle, if short leg is 2, hypotenuse is 4, long leg is 2√3

**Pitfall**: Forgetting the ratios
**Fix**: Memorize the common ratios for special triangles

## Quadrilateral Properties

### Parallelogram Properties
**Opposite sides**: Equal and parallel
**Opposite angles**: Equal
**Diagonals**: Bisect each other
**Area**: Base × height

**Example**: In parallelogram ABCD, if AB = 5 and height to AB is 3, area = 5 × 3 = 15

**Pitfall**: Confusing with rectangle
**Fix**: Parallelogram has opposite sides equal, rectangle has right angles

### Rectangle Properties
**All properties of parallelogram plus**:
**Four right angles**: All angles are 90°
**Diagonals**: Equal length and bisect each other
**Area**: Length × width

**Example**: Rectangle with length 6 and width 4 has area 24 and perimeter 20

**Pitfall**: Forgetting that diagonals are equal
**Fix**: Remember that rectangle diagonals are equal length

### Square Properties
**All properties of rectangle plus**:
**All sides equal**: All four sides have same length
**Diagonals**: Equal length, perpendicular, and bisect each other
**Area**: Side²

**Example**: Square with side 5 has area 25 and perimeter 20

**Pitfall**: Confusing with rectangle
**Fix**: Square has all sides equal, rectangle has opposite sides equal

### Trapezoid Properties
**One pair of parallel sides**: Called bases
**Area**: (1/2) × (base₁ + base₂) × height
**Isosceles trapezoid**: Non-parallel sides equal, base angles equal

**Example**: Trapezoid with bases 6 and 10, height 4 has area (1/2) × (6 + 10) × 4 = 32

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to average the bases
**Fix**: Always average the two bases before multiplying by height

## Circle Properties

### Basic Circle Formulas

**Pitfall**: Confusing circumference and area formulas
**Fix**: Circumference has 2π, area has π²

### Chord Properties
**Perpendicular from center**: Bisects chord
**Equal chords**: Equidistant from center
**Power of a point**: AB × BC = DB × BE

**Example**: If chord is 8 and distance from center is 3, radius is √(4² + 3²) = 5

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to use right triangle
**Fix**: Use right triangle formed by radius, half-chord, and distance from center

### Tangent Properties
**Perpendicular to radius**: At point of tangency
**Equal lengths**: From external point to circle
**Power of a point**: (Tangent length)² = (Secant length) × (External part)

**Example**: If tangent is 6 and secant is 9, external part is 9 - 6 = 3

**Pitfall**: Forgetting that tangent is perpendicular to radius
**Fix**: Always use right triangle formed by tangent and radius

## Similarity and Congruence

### Similarity Tests
**AA**: Two angles equal
**SAS**: Two sides proportional and included angle equal

**Fix**: Always verify all required conditions for similarity

### Congruence Tests
**SSS**: All three sides equal

**Example**: Triangles with sides 3, 4, 5 and 3, 4, 5 are congruent (SSS)

**Pitfall**: Using wrong test
**Fix**: Always use the appropriate test for the given information

### Scale Factor
**Definition**: Ratio of corresponding sides
**Area ratio**: (Scale factor)²
**Volume ratio**: (Scale factor)³

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to square for area, cube for volume
**Fix**: Always use correct power for the dimension

## Area and Perimeter

### Basic Area Formulas
**Rectangle**: A = length × width
**Square**: A = side²
**Triangle**: A = (1/2) × base × height
**Parallelogram**: A = base × height
**Trapezoid**: A = (1/2) × (base₁ + base₂) × height
**Circle**: A = πr²

**Example**: Triangle with base 6 and height 4 has area (1/2) × 6 × 4 = 12

**Pitfall**: Forgetting the (1/2) for triangle
**Fix**: Always include (1/2) for triangle area

### Composite Figures
**Method**: Break into basic shapes, find area of each, add together
**Example**: L-shaped figure = rectangle + triangle

## Transformations

**Fix**: Always add to both x and y coordinates

### Reflections
**Over x-axis**: (x, y) → (x, -y)
**Over y-axis**: (x, y) → (-x, y)

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to change sign
**Fix**: Always change the sign of the appropriate coordinate

### Rotations
**90° counterclockwise**: (x, y) → (-y, x)
