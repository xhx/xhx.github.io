# ðŸ“Š Ratios, Rates, Proportions â€” Problem Types

Master the common problem patterns and systematic solution approaches for ratio, rate, and proportion problems.

## Basic Ratio Problems

### Simplifying Ratios
**Recognition**: Questions asking to simplify ratios to lowest terms
**Template**:
1. Find GCF of both numbers
2. Divide both terms by GCF
3. Check if further simplification is possible

**Example**: Simplify $24:36$
1. **GCF**: GCF(24, 36) = 12
2. **Divide**: $24 \div 12 = 2$, $36 \div 12 = 3$
3. **Result**: $24:36 = 2:3$

**Common variations**:
- Simplify $a:b$ to lowest terms
- Find equivalent ratios
- Compare ratios

### Finding Missing Terms
**Recognition**: Questions with one missing term in a ratio
**Template**:
1. Set up proportion
2. Use cross multiplication
3. Solve for unknown

**Example**: If $3:4 = x:12$, find $x$
1. **Proportion**: $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{12}$
2. **Cross multiply**: $3 \times 12 = 4x$
3. **Solve**: $36 = 4x$, so $x = 9$

**Common variations**:
- Find missing numerator

1. **Current**: 60 mph
2. **Target**: ft/s
3. **Convert**: $60 \times \frac{5280 \text{ ft}}{3600 \text{ s}} = 88 \text{ ft/s}$

**Common variations**:
- Speed unit conversions
- Price unit conversions
- Work rate conversions
- Flow rate conversions

## Proportion Problems

### Direct Proportion Problems
**Recognition**: Questions where one quantity varies directly with another

2. Use cross multiplication
3. Solve for unknown

**Example**: If 3 apples cost $1.50, how much do 8 apples cost?
1. **Proportion**: $\frac{3}{1.50} = \frac{8}{x}$
2. **Cross multiply**: $3x = 1.50 \times 8 = 12$
3. **Solve**: $x = 4$

**Common variations**:
- Price-quantity problems
- Distance-time problems
- Work-time problems
- Scale problems

### Inverse Proportion Problems
**Recognition**: Questions where one quantity varies inversely with another
**Template**:
1. Set up inverse proportion
2. Use product rule
3. Solve for unknown

**Example**: If 4 workers can build a wall in 6 days, how long for 8 workers?
1. **Inverse proportion**: $4 \times 6 = 8 \times x$
2. **Product rule**: $24 = 8x$
3. **Solve**: $x = 3$ days

**Common variations**:
- Work-time problems
- Speed-time problems
- Pressure-volume problems
- Resistance-current problems

## Word Problems

### Part-Whole Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about parts of a whole
**Template**:
1. Identify part and whole
2. Set up ratio
3. Use proportion to find unknown

**Example**: In a class of 30 students, the ratio of boys to girls is 2:3. How many boys are there?
1. **Part**: boys, **Whole**: total students
2. **Ratio**: boys:total = 2:5
3. **Proportion**: $\frac{2}{5} = \frac{x}{30}$, so $x = 12$ boys

**Common variations**:
- Gender ratio problems
- Age ratio problems
- Grade ratio problems
- Color ratio problems

### Mixture Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about mixing different concentrations
**Template**:
1. Set up weighted average equation
2. Solve for unknown
3. Check answer

**Example**: Mix 2 liters of 20% acid with 3 liters of 80% acid. What is the concentration?
1. **Weighted average**: $\frac{2 \times 0.20 + 3 \times 0.80}{2 + 3}$
2. **Calculate**: $\frac{0.4 + 2.4}{5} = 0.56$
3. **Result**: 56% acid

**Common variations**:
- Acid concentration problems
- Alcohol concentration problems
- Salt concentration problems
- Sugar concentration problems

### Work Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about work rates and time
**Template**:
1. Find individual work rates
2. Use combined rate formula
3. Solve for time

**Example**: Pipe A fills tank in 3 hours, Pipe B in 6 hours. How long together?
1. **Rates**: A = $\frac{1}{3}$ tank/hour, B = $\frac{1}{6}$ tank/hour
2. **Combined**: $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ tank/hour
3. **Time**: 2 hours

**Common variations**:
- Pipe filling problems

1. **Step 1**: Find ratio of flour to servings: $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$
2. **Step 2**: Apply to 10 servings: $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$
3. **Step 3**: Solve: $x = 5$ cups

### Rate-Time-Distance Problems
**Recognition**: Problems involving motion
**Template**:
1. Use $d = rt$ formula
2. Set up equations
3. Solve system

**Example**: Two cars start 100 miles apart and drive toward each other. One goes 60 mph, the other 40 mph. When do they meet?
1. **Distance**: $d_1 + d_2 = 100$
2. **Time**: $t_1 = t_2 = t$
3. **Equations**: $60t + 40t = 100$, so $t = 1$ hour

**Common variations**:
- Meeting problems

- Round trip problems
- Upstream/downstream problems

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Ratio Mistakes
**Mistake**: Adding ratios incorrectly: $3:4 + 1:2 = 4:6$
**Fix**: Use proper formula: $(3 \times 2 + 4 \times 1):(4 \times 2) = 10:8 = 5:4$

**Mistake**: Forgetting to simplify
**Fix**: Always divide by GCF

### Proportion Mistakes
**Mistake**: Wrong cross multiplication
**Fix**: Multiply diagonally: $a \times d = b \times c$

**Mistake**: Forgetting units
**Fix**: Always check unit consistency

### Rate Mistakes
**Mistake**: Wrong unit conversion
**Fix**: Use conversion factors carefully

**Mistake**: Confusing direct and inverse
**Fix**: Direct means both increase together
