## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Counting Mistakes
**Mistake**: Using permutations instead of combinations
**Fix**: Use permutations when order matters, combinations when it doesn't

**Mistake**: Forgetting to consider restrictions

**Mistake**: Using wrong formula for repetition
**Fix**: Use n^r for permutations with repetition, C(n + r - 1, r) for combinations with repetition

### Probability Mistakes
**Mistake**: Not counting all possible outcomes
**Fix**: Always count all possible outcomes

**Mistake**: Multiplying when events are not independent
**Fix**: Only multiply when events are independent

**Mistake**: Forgetting to adjust for dependent events
**Fix**: Always adjust for the first event in dependent events

### Expected Value Mistakes

**Fix**: Always consider all possible values of the random variable

**Mistake**: Forgetting linearity properties
**Fix**: Always use linearity properties when applicable
