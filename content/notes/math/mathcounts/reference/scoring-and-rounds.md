# ðŸŽ¯ Scoring and Rounds

Understanding how points are awarded and how strategy differs across rounds.

## Scoring System

### Individual Rounds
- **Sprint Round**: 1 point per correct answer
- **Target Round**: 1 point per correct answer
- **Total Individual Score**: Sprint + Target points

### Team Round
- **Team Score**: 1 point per correct answer
- **Team Ranking**: Based on team score
- **Individual Qualification**: Based on individual score

### Countdown Round
- **Format**: Head-to-head elimination
- **Advancement**: Win your match to advance
- **Tie-breaking**: Sudden death problems

## Round-Specific Strategies

### Sprint Round Strategy
**Goal**: Maximize correct answers in limited time

**Approach**:
1. **First Pass** (15-20 minutes): Answer easy problems
2. **Second Pass** (15-20 minutes): Work on medium problems
3. **Final Pass** (5 minutes): Guess on remaining problems

**Key Tips**:
- Skip problems that take too long
- Use estimation when appropriate
- Double-check arithmetic
- Don't get stuck on one problem

### Target Round Strategy
**Goal**: Accuracy over speed with calculator help

**Approach**:
1. **Read all problems** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Work systematically** through each problem
3. **Use calculator** for complex calculations
4. **Check answers** before moving on

**Key Tips**:
- Use calculator effectively
- Show clear work
- Check units and reasonableness
- Don't rush - you have more time per problem

### Team Round Strategy
**Goal**: Maximize team score through collaboration

**Approach**:
1. **Assign problems** based on strengths
2. **Work independently** on assigned problems
3. **Check each other's work**
4. **Collaborate** on difficult problems

**Key Tips**:
- Communicate clearly
- Divide work efficiently
- Double-check all answers
- Help teammates when needed

### Countdown Round Strategy
**Goal**: Quick, accurate mental math

**Approach**:
1. **Listen carefully** to the problem
2. **Think step by step**
3. **Answer confidently**
4. **Stay calm** under pressure

**Key Tips**:
- Practice mental math daily
- Know common shortcuts
- Stay focused and calm
- Don't second-guess yourself

## Answer Strategies

### Written Rounds
- **Show work** when it helps
- **Use clear notation**
- **Include units** when specified
- **Check arithmetic** carefully

### Countdown Round
- **Answer clearly** and confidently
- **Use standard terms** (e.g., "fifteen" not "fifteen point zero")
- **Don't show work** - just give the answer
- **Stay calm** if you make a mistake

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Sprint Round
- Spending too much time on difficult problems
- Making careless arithmetic errors
- Not using estimation
- Leaving problems blank

### Target Round
- Rushing through problems
- Not using calculator effectively
- Making unit conversion errors
- Not checking answers

### Team Round
- Not communicating with teammates
- Working on the same problem
- Not checking each other's work
- Arguing over approaches

### Countdown Round
- Answering too quickly
- Not listening to the full problem
- Getting flustered by mistakes
- Not staying focused

## Practice Recommendations

### Sprint Practice
- Time yourself on 30-problem sets
- Focus on speed and accuracy

- Work on estimation skills

### Target Practice
- Practice with calculator
- Work on problem-solving strategies
- Focus on accuracy
- Time yourself appropriately

### Team Practice
- Practice with teammates
- Work on communication
- Practice problem division
- Simulate team conditions

### Countdown Practice
- Practice mental math daily
- Work on quick problem recognition
- Practice under time pressure
- Build confidence
