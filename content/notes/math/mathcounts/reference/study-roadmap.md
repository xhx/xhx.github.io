# üó∫Ô∏è Study Roadmap

A structured approach to MATHCOUNTS preparation that builds skills systematically.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-2)

### Week 1-2: Assessment

- **Study number properties** (even/odd, prime/composite, divisibility)

### Week 3-4: Core Concepts
- **Master fractions** (operations, conversions, comparisons)
- **Learn decimals** (operations, rounding, scientific notation)
- **Understand percents** (conversions, calculations, applications)
- **Practice ratios and proportions** (basic concepts, cross-multiplication)

### Week 5-6: Algebra Basics
- **Learn variables** (substitution, evaluation, simplification)
- **Master linear equations** (solving, graphing, word problems)
- **Practice patterns** (arithmetic, geometric, recursive)
- **Study inequalities** (solving, graphing, compound)

### Week 7-8: Geometry Foundation
- **Learn basic shapes** (triangles, quadrilaterals, circles)
- **Master area and perimeter** (formulas, applications)
- **Study angles** (types, relationships, measurements)
- **Practice coordinate geometry** (plotting, distance, midpoint)

## Phase 2: Skill Development (Months 3-4)

### Week 9-10: Number Theory
- **Study prime numbers** (identification, factorization)
- **Learn divisibility rules** (2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11)
- **Master GCD and LCM** (Euclidean algorithm, applications)
- **Practice modular arithmetic** (remainders, clock arithmetic)

### Week 11-12: Counting and Probability
- **Learn basic counting** (permutations, combinations)
- **Study probability** (basic concepts, independent events)
- **Practice tree diagrams** (systematic counting)
- **Master complement principle** (at least one, at most one)

### Week 13-14: Advanced Algebra
- **Study systems of equations** (substitution, elimination)
- **Learn quadratic equations** (factoring, completing square)
- **Practice word problems** (translation, setup, solving)
- **Master function concepts** (evaluation, composition)

### Week 15-16: Solid Geometry
- **Learn 3D shapes** (prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, spheres)
- **Master volume formulas** (applications, composite solids)
- **Study surface area** (formulas, nets, applications)
- **Practice cross-sections** (visualization, calculations)

## Phase 3: Integration and Practice (Months 5-6)

### Week 17-18: Mixed Practice
- **Take practice tests** (full-length, timed)
- **Review weak areas** (targeted practice)
- **Practice mental math** (daily drills)
- **Study problem-solving strategies** (systematic approaches)

### Week 19-20: Round-Specific Practice
- **Sprint practice** (speed and accuracy)
- **Target practice** (calculator skills)
- **Team practice** (collaboration)
- **Countdown practice** (mental math under pressure)

### Week 21-22: Advanced Topics
- **Study sequences and series** (arithmetic, geometric)
- **Learn data analysis** (mean, median, mode, range)
- **Practice logic problems** (truth tables, Venn diagrams)
- **Master rate problems** (work, mixture, motion)

### Week 23-24: Final Preparation
- **Take full-length practice tests** (weekly)
- **Review all formulas** (comprehensive)
- **Practice under pressure** (timed conditions)
- **Build confidence** (positive mindset)

## Daily Study Schedule

### Monday-Friday (30-45 minutes)
- **Warm-up** (5 minutes): Mental math drills
- **New material** (20-30 minutes): Study new concepts
- **Practice problems** (10-15 minutes): Apply new knowledge
- **Review** (5 minutes): Check work and notes

### Saturday (60-90 minutes)
- **Practice test** (40-60 minutes): Full-length or partial
- **Review mistakes** (20-30 minutes): Analyze errors
- **Study weak areas** (10-15 minutes): Targeted practice

### Sunday (30-45 minutes)
- **Review week's material** (15-20 minutes): Consolidate learning
- **Plan next week** (10-15 minutes): Set goals
- **Relax and recharge** (10-15 minutes): Mental break

## Study Techniques

### Active Learning
- **Solve problems** rather than just reading
- **Explain concepts** to others (or yourself)
- **Create flashcards** for formulas and facts
- **Practice regularly** to build fluency

### Problem-Solving Process
1. **Read carefully** - understand what's being asked
2. **Identify type** - recognize the problem pattern
3. **Choose strategy** - select appropriate method
4. **Solve systematically** - work step by step
5. **Check answer** - verify reasonableness

### Memory Techniques
- **Use mnemonics** for formulas and rules
- **Create visual aids** for complex concepts
- **Practice regularly** to build long-term memory
- **Connect new ideas** to existing knowledge

## Assessment and Adjustment

### Weekly Check-ins
- **Review progress** against goals
- **Identify weak areas** for extra practice
- **Adjust schedule** as needed
- **Celebrate successes** to maintain motivation

### Monthly Assessments
- **Take practice tests** to measure progress
- **Analyze performance** by topic and round
- **Update study plan** based on results
- **Set new goals** for next month

### Final Preparation
- **Take full-length tests** weekly
- **Simulate competition conditions** (timing, environment)
- **Review all material** systematically
- **Build confidence** through preparation

## Resources and Support

### Study Materials
- **MATHCOUNTS problem sets** (official and practice)
- **Textbooks** (middle school and competition math)
- **Online resources** (videos, practice problems)
- **Study groups** (peer learning and support)

### Practice Tests
- **Official MATHCOUNTS** (past competitions)
- **Practice problems** (various sources)
- **Mock competitions** (simulated conditions)
- **Timed drills** (specific skills)

### Support System
- **Teachers and coaches** (guidance and feedback)
- **Study partners** (collaboration and motivation)
- **Family support** (encouragement and resources)
- **Online communities** (tips and encouragement)
