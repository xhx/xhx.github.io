# ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic â€” Problem Types

Master the common arithmetic problem patterns and their systematic solution approaches.

## Basic Calculation Problems

### Single Operation Problems
**Recognition**: One arithmetic operation required
**Template**:
1. Identify the operation
2. Set up the calculation
3. Perform the operation
4. Check your answer

**Example**: What is $47 + 23$?
1. **Operation**: Addition
2. **Setup**: $47 + 23$
3. **Calculate**: $47 + 23 = 70$
4. **Check**: $70 - 23 = 47$ âœ“

**Common variations**:
- Addition: $a + b = ?$
- Subtraction: $a - b = ?$
- Multiplication: $a \times b = ?$
- Division: $a \div b = ?$

### Multiple Operation Problems
**Recognition**: Order of operations required
**Template**:
1. Identify all operations
2. Apply PEMDAS/BODMAS
3. Work step by step
4. Check each step

**Example**: What is $2 + 3 \times 4^2 - (6 + 2) \div 2$?
1. **Operations**: Addition, multiplication, exponentiation, subtraction, division
2. **PEMDAS**: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction
3. **Steps**:
   - Parentheses: $6 + 2 = 8$
   - Exponents: $4^2 = 16$
   - Multiplication: $3 \times 16 = 48$
   - Division: $8 \div 2 = 4$
   - Addition: $2 + 48 = 50$
   - Subtraction: $50 - 4 = 46$
4. **Answer**: $46$

## Number Property Problems

### Even/Odd Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about even/odd properties
**Template**:
1. Identify the numbers involved
2. Apply even/odd properties
3. Determine the result
4. Check your reasoning

**Example**: Is $47 + 23$ even or odd?
1. **Numbers**: 47 (odd), 23 (odd)
2. **Property**: Odd + Odd = Even
3. **Result**: Even
4. **Check**: $47 + 23 = 70$ (ends in 0, so even) âœ“

**Common variations**:
- Sum of even/odd numbers
- Product of even/odd numbers
- Powers of even/odd numbers
- Combinations of operations

### Prime Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about prime numbers
**Template**:
1. Identify the number
2. Check if it's prime
3. Apply prime properties
4. Solve the problem

**Example**: Is 47 prime?
1. **Number**: 47
2. **Check**: Test divisibility by primes up to $\sqrt{47} \approx 6.86$
   - 2: 47 is odd, so not divisible by 2
   - 3: $4 + 7 = 11$, not divisible by 3
   - 5: Doesn't end in 0 or 5
3. **Result**: 47 is prime
4. **Check**: 47 has exactly two factors (1 and 47) âœ“

**Common variations**:
- Prime identification
- Prime factorization
- GCD/LCM problems
- Prime counting problems

### Divisibility Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about divisibility
**Template**:
1. Identify the number and divisor
2. Apply divisibility rules
3. Determine divisibility
4. Check your answer

**Example**: Is 1,234 divisible by 3?
1. **Number**: 1,234, **Divisor**: 3
2. **Rule**: Sum of digits must be divisible by 3
3. **Calculate**: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$
4. **Check**: 10 is not divisible by 3, so 1,234 is not divisible by 3

**Common variations**:
- Single divisibility checks
- Multiple divisibility checks
- Finding divisors
- Divisibility in word problems

## Estimation Problems

### Rounding Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about rounding
**Template**:
1. Identify the number and place to round
2. Look at the digit to the right
3. Apply rounding rules
4. Check your answer

**Example**: Round 3,247 to the nearest hundred
1. **Number**: 3,247, **Place**: Hundreds
2. **Digit to right**: 4 (in tens place)
3. **Rule**: 4 < 5, so round down
4. **Answer**: 3,200

**Common variations**:
- Round to nearest ten, hundred, thousand
- Round decimals to specified places
- Round to significant figures
- Round in word problems

### Approximation Problems
**Recognition**: Questions about approximate values
**Template**:
1. Identify what needs to be approximated
2. Choose appropriate estimation method
3. Perform the estimation
4. Check reasonableness

**Example**: Estimate $347 + 256$
1. **Operation**: Addition
2. **Method**: Front-end estimation
3. **Calculate**: $300 + 200 = 500$
4. **Check**: Actual answer is 603, so estimate is reasonable

**Common variations**:
- Front-end estimation
- Compatible numbers
- Benchmark estimation
- Estimation in word problems

## Word Problems

### Basic Word Problems
**Recognition**: Real-world situations with arithmetic
**Template**:
1. Read the problem carefully
2. Identify what's given and what's asked
3. Translate words to arithmetic
4. Solve and check

**Example**: A store has 47 apples and buys 23 more. How many apples does it have now?
1. **Given**: 47 apples, buys 23 more
2. **Asked**: Total number of apples
3. **Translation**: $47 + 23 = ?$

**Example**: A store has 47 apples. It sells 23 apples and then buys 15 more. How many apples does it have now?
1. **Step 1**: Start with 47 apples
2. **Step 2**: Sell 23: $47 - 23 = 24$ apples
3. **Step 3**: Buy 15 more: $24 + 15 = 39$ apples
4. **Answer**: 39 apples

**Common variations**:
- Sequential operations

2. **Rule**: Multiply all numbers
3. **Apply**: $2 \times 3 = 6$, $6 \times 4 = 24$, $24 \times 5 = 120$
4. **Answer**: 120

**Common variations**:
- Factorial problems
- Power problems
- Sum problems
- Product problems

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Careless Errors
**Mistake**: Arithmetic mistakes like $2 + 3 = 6$
**Fix**: Slow down and double-check each step

### Order of Operations Errors
**Mistake**: $2 + 3 \times 4 = 20$ (should be 14)
**Fix**: Use PEMDAS/BODMAS systematically

### Sign Errors
**Mistake**: Forgetting negative signs
**Fix**: Pay attention to signs and double-check

### Copying Errors
**Mistake**: Writing 47 instead of 74
**Fix**: Show work clearly and check each step
