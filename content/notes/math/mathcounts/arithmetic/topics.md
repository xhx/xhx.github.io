# ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic â€” Topics

Master the core arithmetic topics that appear frequently in MATHCOUNTS problems.

## Number Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
**Basic techniques**:
- **Column addition**: Line up digits by place value
- **Mental math**: Use compatible numbers and shortcuts
- **Estimation**: Round to check reasonableness

**Common patterns**:
- **Near multiples of 10**: $47 + 19 = 47 + 20 - 1 = 66$
- **Complementary numbers**: $47 + 53 = 100$
- **Breaking apart**: $47 + 23 = (40 + 20) + (7 + 3) = 70$

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to carry or borrow
**Fix**: Show work clearly and double-check each step

### Multiplication and Division
**Basic techniques**:
- **Long multiplication**: Multiply each digit systematically
- **Mental math**: Use shortcuts and properties
- **Estimation**: Round to check reasonableness

**Common patterns**:
- **Multiplying by powers of 10**: Add zeros
- **Multiplying by 5**: Multiply by 10, divide by 2
- **Multiplying by 25**: Multiply by 100, divide by 4

**Pitfall**: Misplacing decimal points
**Fix**: Count decimal places carefully

## Number Properties

### Even and Odd Numbers
**Recognition**: Check the last digit
**Properties**:
- Even + Even = Even
- Odd + Odd = Even
- Even + Odd = Odd
- Even Ã— Even = Even
- Odd Ã— Odd = Odd
- Even Ã— Odd = Even

**Applications**:
- **Parity problems**: Determine if result is even or odd
- **Counting problems**: Count even/odd numbers in a range
- **Algebra problems**: Use properties to simplify expressions

**Pitfall**: Forgetting that 0 is even
**Fix**: Remember that even means divisible by 2

### Prime and Composite Numbers
**Prime identification**: Check divisibility by primes up to $\sqrt{n}$
**First 25 primes**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

**Applications**:
- **Factorization**: Break numbers into prime factors
- **GCD/LCM**: Find greatest common divisor and least common multiple
- **Number theory**: Solve problems involving prime properties

**Pitfall**: Thinking 1 is prime
**Fix**: Remember that primes have exactly two factors

### Divisibility Rules
**Memorize key rules**:
- **2**: Last digit is even
- **3**: Sum of digits is divisible by 3
- **4**: Last two digits divisible by 4
- **5**: Last digit is 0 or 5
- **6**: Divisible by both 2 and 3
- **9**: Sum of digits is divisible by 9
- **10**: Last digit is 0

**Applications**:
- **Quick checks**: Verify divisibility without division
- **Factorization**: Find factors efficiently
- **Problem solving**: Use rules to eliminate answer choices

**Pitfall**: Forgetting to check all digits
**Fix**: Add digits systematically

## Order of Operations

### PEMDAS/BODMAS
**Parentheses/Brackets**: Do operations inside first
**Exponents/Orders**: Calculate powers and roots
**Multiplication/Division**: From left to right
**Addition/Subtraction**: From left to right

**Common mistakes**:
- **Adding before multiplying**: $2 + 3 \times 4 = 20$ (should be 14)
- **Subtracting before dividing**: $8 - 4 \div 2 = 2$ (should be 6)
- **Forgetting parentheses**: $2(3 + 4) = 14$ (not 10)

**Fix**: Use parentheses to clarify order

## Mental Math Techniques

### Shortcuts
**Addition**:
- Adding 9: Add 10, subtract 1
- Adding 11: Add 10, add 1
- Adding near multiples of 10: Use compatible numbers

**Subtraction**:
- Subtracting 9: Subtract 10, add 1
- Subtracting 11: Subtract 10, subtract 1
- Subtracting near multiples of 10: Use compatible numbers

**Multiplication**:
- Multiplying by 5: Multiply by 10, divide by 2
- Multiplying by 25: Multiply by 100, divide by 4
- Multiplying by 11: Add digits and place in middle

**Division**:
- Dividing by 5: Multiply by 2, divide by 10
- Dividing by 25: Multiply by 4, divide by 100
- Dividing by 4: Divide by 2 twice

### Estimation
**Front-end estimation**: Use first digits
**Compatible numbers**: Use easy-to-work-with numbers
**Benchmark estimation**: Use known reference points

**Applications**:
- **Quick checks**: Verify calculations
- **Problem solving**: Narrow down answer choices
- **Time management**: Skip exact calculations when appropriate

## Number Sense

### Place Value
**Understanding**: Each position represents a power of 10
**Applications**:
- **Rounding**: Use place value to round correctly
- **Estimation**: Use place value for quick estimates
- **Problem solving**: Break numbers into parts

### Rounding
**Rules**:
- **0-4**: Round down
- **5-9**: Round up
- **Ties**: Round to even (banker's rounding)

**Applications**:
- **Estimation**: Round to make calculations easier
- **Problem solving**: Use rounded numbers to check answers
- **Real-world problems**: Round to appropriate precision

### Scientific Notation
**Format**: $a \times 10^n$ where $1 \leq a < 10$
**Examples**:
- $3,400 = 3.4 \times 10^3$
- $0.0007 = 7 \times 10^{-4}$

**Applications**:
- **Large numbers**: Express very large or very small numbers
- **Calculations**: Simplify multiplication and division
- **Problem solving**: Use scientific notation in word problems

## Common Problem Types

### Basic Calculations
**Single operations**: One arithmetic operation
**Multiple operations**: Order of operations required
**Word problems**: Translate words to arithmetic

### Number Properties
**Even/odd problems**: Use properties to solve
**Prime problems**: Use prime properties
**Divisibility problems**: Use divisibility rules

### Estimation Problems
**Rounding**: Round to specified place
**Approximation**: Find approximate values
**Comparison**: Compare numbers using estimation
