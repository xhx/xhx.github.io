# ‚è±Ô∏è Rate, Time, Work, and Mixture Formulas

## üéØ Basic Rate Formulas

### **Distance, Rate, Time**
$$D = R \times T$$

**Usage**: Find distance when rate and time are known
**Micro-example**: If rate is 60 mph and time is 2 hours, distance = $60 \times 2 = 120$ miles

### **Rate Formula**
$$R = \frac{D}{T}$$

**Usage**: Find rate when distance and time are known
**Micro-example**: If distance is 150 miles and time is 3 hours, rate = $\frac{150}{3} = 50$ mph

### **Time Formula**
$$T = \frac{D}{R}$$

**Usage**: Find time when distance and rate are known
**Micro-example**: If distance is 200 miles and rate is 40 mph, time = $\frac{200}{40} = 5$ hours

## üîÑ Relative Rate Formulas

### **Approaching Objects**
$$R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$$

**Usage**: When two objects move toward each other
**Micro-example**: Two cars at 40 mph and 60 mph approach at $40 + 60 = 100$ mph

### **Separating Objects**
$$R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$$

**Usage**: When two objects move away from each other
**Micro-example**: Two cars at 30 mph and 50 mph separate at $30 + 50 = 80$ mph

### **Same Direction**
$$R_{relative} = |R_1 - R_2|$$

**Usage**: When two objects move in the same direction
**Micro-example**: Car at 60 mph passing car at 40 mph has relative speed of $60 - 40 = 20$ mph

## üîß Work Formulas

### **Work, Rate, Time**
$$W = R \times T$$

**Usage**: Find work completed when rate and time are known
**Micro-example**: If rate is 5 jobs/hour and time is 3 hours, work = $5 \times 3 = 15$ jobs

### **Work Rate**
$$R = \frac{W}{T}$$

**Usage**: Find rate when work and time are known
**Micro-example**: If 12 jobs are completed in 4 hours, rate = $\frac{12}{4} = 3$ jobs/hour

### **Work Time**
$$T = \frac{W}{R}$$

**Usage**: Find time when work and rate are known
**Micro-example**: If 20 jobs need to be done at 4 jobs/hour, time = $\frac{20}{4} = 5$ hours

### **Combined Work Rate**
$$R_{combined} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$

**Usage**: Find total rate when multiple people work together
**Micro-example**: If A works at 2 jobs/hour and B works at 3 jobs/hour, combined rate = $2 + 3 = 5$ jobs/hour

## üß™ Mixture Formulas

### **Basic Mixture**
$$\text{Amount} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Total}$$

**Usage**: Find amount of pure substance in a mixture
**Micro-example**: 25% of 80 gallons = $0.25 \times 80 = 20$ gallons

### **Concentration**
$$\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Amount}}{\text{Total}}$$

**Usage**: Find concentration after mixing
**Micro-example**: If 15 gallons of pure substance are in 50 gallons total, concentration = $\frac{15}{50} = 0.30 = 30\%$

### **Two-Part Mixture**
$$C_1 \times A_1 + C_2 \times A_2 = C_{final} \times (A_1 + A_2)$$

**Usage**: Find final concentration when mixing two solutions
**Micro-example**: Mix 10 gallons of 30% solution with 20 gallons of 50% solution:
- $0.30 \times 10 + 0.50 \times 20 = 3 + 10 = 13$ gallons of substance
- Final concentration = $\frac{13}{30} = 43.\overline{3}\%$

## üìä Average Rate

### **Weighted Average Rate**
$$R_{avg} = \frac{D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + ...}{T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + ...}$$

**Usage**: Find average rate over multiple segments
**Micro-example**: Drive 60 miles at 40 mph, then 40 miles at 60 mph:
- Total distance = 100 miles
- Total time = $\frac{60}{40} + \frac{40}{60} = 1.5 + 0.67 = 2.17$ hours
- Average rate = $\frac{100}{2.17} \approx 46.1$ mph

## üí° Quick Reference

| **Problem Type** | **Formula** | **Usage** |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Distance | $D = R \times T$ | Find distance |
| Rate | $R = \frac{D}{T}$ | Find rate |
| Time | $T = \frac{D}{R}$ | Find time |
| Approaching | $R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$ | Objects moving toward each other |
| Same Direction | $R_{relative} = |R_1 - R_2|$ | Objects moving in same direction |
| Work | $W = R \times T$ | Find work completed |
| Combined Work | $R_{combined} = R_1 + R_2$ | Multiple people working together |
| Mixture | Amount = Conc. √ó Total | Find amount of substance |
| Two-Part Mix | $C_1A_1 + C_2A_2 = C_{final}(A_1 + A_2)$ | Mix two solutions |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Rate vs Time**: Don't mix up which variable to solve for
- **Relative Rates**: Add for approaching/separating, subtract for same direction
- **Work Rates**: Add rates when working together
- **Mixture Math**: Convert percentages to decimals first
- **Average Rate**: Use weighted average, not simple average
