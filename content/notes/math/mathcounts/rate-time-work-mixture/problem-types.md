# üéØ Rate, Time, Work, and Mixture Problem Types

## üìä Problem Pattern Catalog

### **Type 1: Basic Rate Problems**
**Pattern**: Find distance, rate, or time using $D = R \times T$
**Key Formula**: $D = R \times T$, $R = \frac{D}{T}$, $T = \frac{D}{R}$

**Worked Example**:
> A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. What is its average speed?
> 
> **Solution**:
> $R = \frac{D}{T} = \frac{240}{4} = 60$ mph

### **Type 2: Work Problems**
**Pattern**: Find work completed, rate, or time using $W = R \times T$
**Key Formula**: $W = R \times T$, $R = \frac{W}{T}$, $T = \frac{W}{R}$

**Worked Example**:
> If 3 workers can complete 12 jobs in 4 hours, how many jobs can 5 workers complete in 6 hours?
> 
> **Solution**:
> First find individual rate: $R = \frac{W}{T} = \frac{12}{4} = 3$ jobs/hour per worker
> 
> With 5 workers: $R_{total} = 5 \times 3 = 15$ jobs/hour
> 
> In 6 hours: $W = R \times T = 15 \times 6 = 90$ jobs

### **Type 3: Relative Rate Problems**
**Pattern**: Find when two objects meet or how fast they approach/separate
**Key Concept**: Add rates for approaching/separating, subtract for same direction

**Worked Example**:
> Two cars start 200 miles apart and drive toward each other. One travels 50 mph, the other 60 mph. How long until they meet?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Relative rate = $50 + 60 = 110$ mph (approaching)
> 
> Time = $\frac{D}{R} = \frac{200}{110} = \frac{20}{11} \approx 1.82$ hours

### **Type 4: Mixture Problems**
**Pattern**: Find concentration or amount after mixing different solutions
**Key Formula**: Amount = Concentration √ó Total

**Worked Example**:
> Mix 20 gallons of 30% acid solution with 30 gallons of 50% acid solution. What is the final concentration?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Amount of acid in first solution: $0.30 \times 20 = 6$ gallons
> 
> Amount of acid in second solution: $0.50 \times 30 = 15$ gallons
> 
> Total acid: $6 + 15 = 21$ gallons
> 
> Total solution: $20 + 30 = 50$ gallons
> 
> Final concentration: $\frac{21}{50} = 0.42 = 42\%$

### **Type 5: Combined Work Problems**
**Pattern**: Find time when multiple people work together
**Key Concept**: Add individual rates to get combined rate

**Worked Example**:
> Alice can paint a room in 6 hours, Bob can paint it in 4 hours. How long will it take them to paint it together?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Alice's rate: $\frac{1}{6}$ room/hour
> 
> Bob's rate: $\frac{1}{4}$ room/hour
> 
> Combined rate: $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$ room/hour
> 
> Time together: $\frac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4$ hours

## üîç Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify the type** of problem (rate, work, mixture)
2. **Write down what you know** about each quantity
3. **Use the appropriate formula** for the situation
4. **Set up equations** if multiple unknowns
5. **Check your answer** with estimation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Mixing up rate and time** in formulas
- **Wrong relative rate** for same direction vs. approaching
- **Forgetting to convert units** (hours to minutes, etc.)
- **Miscounting work rates** in combined problems
- **Wrong concentration** calculations in mixtures
