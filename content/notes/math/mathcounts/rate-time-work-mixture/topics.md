# ‚è±Ô∏è Rate, Time, Work, and Mixture Topics

## üéØ Core Subtopics

### **Basic Rate Problems**
- **Formula**: $D = R \times T$
- **Solving for each variable**: $R = \frac{D}{T}$, $T = \frac{D}{R}$
- **Micro-example**: If distance is 120 miles and time is 2 hours, rate = $\frac{120}{2} = 60$ mph
- **Trap**: Mixing up which variable to solve for

### **Work Problems**
- **Formula**: $W = R \times T$
- **Individual rates**: Rate = Work/Time
- **Combined rates**: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$
- **Micro-example**: If A works at 3 jobs/hour and B works at 2 jobs/hour, together they work at 5 jobs/hour
- **Trap**: Forgetting to add rates when working together

### **Relative Rate Problems**
- **Approaching**: $R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$
- **Same direction**: $R_{relative} = |R_1 - R_2|$
- **Micro-example**: Two cars at 40 mph and 60 mph approaching have relative speed of 100 mph
- **Trap**: Using wrong formula for same direction vs. approaching

### **Mixture Problems**
- **Basic formula**: Amount = Concentration √ó Total
- **Concentration formula**: Concentration = Amount/Total
- **Micro-example**: 25% of 80 gallons = $0.25 \times 80 = 20$ gallons
- **Trap**: Forgetting to convert percentages to decimals

### **Percent Mixture Problems**
- **Two-part mixtures**: $C_1 \times A_1 + C_2 \times A_2 = C_{final} \times (A_1 + A_2)$
- **Micro-example**: Mix 10 gallons of 30% solution with 20 gallons of 50% solution:
  - Total substance: $0.30 \times 10 + 0.50 \times 20 = 13$ gallons
  - Final concentration: $\frac{13}{30} = 43.\overline{3}\%$
- **Trap**: Not accounting for total volume in final concentration

### **Time and Distance with Multiple Stops**
- **Total distance**: Sum of all segments
- **Total time**: Sum of all time segments
- **Average rate**: Total distance/Total time
- **Micro-example**: Drive 60 miles at 40 mph, then 40 miles at 60 mph:
  - Total distance: 100 miles
  - Total time: $\frac{60}{40} + \frac{40}{60} = 1.5 + 0.67 = 2.17$ hours
  - Average rate: $\frac{100}{2.17} \approx 46.1$ mph
- **Trap**: Using simple average instead of weighted average

## üö® Common Traps

1. **Rate vs Time**: Confusing which variable to solve for
2. **Relative Rates**: Using wrong formula for same direction
3. **Work Rates**: Forgetting to add rates when working together
4. **Mixture Math**: Not converting percentages to decimals
5. **Average Rate**: Using simple average instead of weighted average

## üí° Quick Tips

- **Rate Problems**: Always check units (mph, jobs/hour, etc.)
- **Work Problems**: Add rates when working together
- **Relative Rates**: Add for approaching/separating, subtract for same direction
- **Mixtures**: Convert percentages to decimals first
- **Time Calculations**: Be careful with unit conversions
