# ‚è±Ô∏è Rate, Time, Work, and Mixture Reference

## üéØ Key Concepts

### **Rate**
The amount of something that happens per unit of time.

### **Work**
The amount of a task that can be completed.

### **Mixture**
A combination of different substances with different properties.

### **Relative Rate**
The rate at which two objects approach or separate from each other.

## üìê Basic Rate Formulas

### **Distance, Rate, Time**
$$D = R \times T$$

**Usage**: Find distance, rate, or time when two are known
**Example**: If you travel 60 mph for 2 hours, distance = $60 \times 2 = 120$ miles

### **Work, Rate, Time**
$$W = R \times T$$

**Usage**: Find work completed, rate, or time when two are known
**Example**: If you work at 5 jobs/hour for 3 hours, work = $5 \times 3 = 15$ jobs

## üîÑ Relative Rates

### **Approaching Objects**
$$R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$$

**Usage**: When two objects move toward each other
**Example**: Two cars at 40 mph and 60 mph approach at $40 + 60 = 100$ mph

### **Separating Objects**
$$R_{relative} = R_1 + R_2$$

**Usage**: When two objects move away from each other
**Example**: Two cars at 30 mph and 50 mph separate at $30 + 50 = 80$ mph

### **Same Direction**
$$R_{relative} = |R_1 - R_2|$$

**Usage**: When two objects move in the same direction
**Example**: Car at 60 mph passing car at 40 mph has relative speed of $60 - 40 = 20$ mph

## üß™ Mixture Problems

### **Basic Mixture Formula**
$$\text{Amount of substance} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Total amount}$$

**Usage**: Find amount of pure substance in a mixture
**Example**: 20% of 100 gallons = $0.20 \times 100 = 20$ gallons

### **Mixture Concentration**
$$\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Amount of substance}}{\text{Total amount}}$$

**Usage**: Find concentration after mixing
**Example**: Mix 10 gallons of 30% solution with 20 gallons of 50% solution:
- Total substance: $0.30 \times 10 + 0.50 \times 20 = 3 + 10 = 13$ gallons
- Total mixture: $10 + 20 = 30$ gallons
- Concentration: $\frac{13}{30} = 43.\overline{3}\%$

## üî¢ Work Problems

### **Individual Work Rate**
$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Work completed}}{\text{Time taken}}$$

**Usage**: Find how fast someone works
**Example**: If you complete 12 jobs in 4 hours, rate = $\frac{12}{4} = 3$ jobs/hour

### **Combined Work Rate**
$$R_{combined} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$

**Usage**: Find total rate when multiple people work together
**Example**: If A works at 2 jobs/hour and B works at 3 jobs/hour, combined rate = $2 + 3 = 5$ jobs/hour

### **Time to Complete Work**
$$T = \frac{W}{R}$$

**Usage**: Find time needed to complete work
**Example**: If combined rate is 5 jobs/hour and there are 20 jobs, time = $\frac{20}{5} = 4$ hours

## üí° Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Identify what you're looking for** (distance, time, rate, work, concentration)
2. **Write down what you know** about each quantity
3. **Use the appropriate formula** for the situation
4. **Set up equations** if multiple unknowns
5. **Check your answer** with estimation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Mixing up rate and time** in formulas
- **Wrong relative rate** for same direction
- **Forgetting to convert units** (hours to minutes, etc.)
- **Miscounting work rates** in combined problems
- **Wrong concentration** calculations in mixtures
