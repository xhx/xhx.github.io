# üéØ Solid Geometry Problem Types

## üìä Problem Pattern Catalog

### **Type 1: Basic Volume Calculations**
**Pattern**: Find volume of a basic solid given dimensions
**Key Formula**: Use appropriate volume formula for the solid

**Worked Example**:
> Find the volume of a cylinder with radius 4 cm and height 10 cm.
> 
> **Solution**:
> $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot 4^2 \cdot 10 = \pi \cdot 16 \cdot 10 = 160\pi$ cm¬≥

### **Type 2: Surface Area Calculations**
**Pattern**: Find total surface area of a 3D object
**Key Formula**: Sum of all face areas

**Worked Example**:
> Find the surface area of a cube with side length 5.
> 
> **Solution**:
> $SA = 6s^2 = 6 \cdot 5^2 = 6 \cdot 25 = 150$ square units

### **Type 3: Volume by Decomposition**
**Pattern**: Find volume of complex shape by breaking into simpler parts
**Key Concept**: Add or subtract volumes of component solids

**Worked Example**:
> Find the volume of an L-shaped prism with dimensions as shown.
> 
> **Solution**:
> Break into two rectangular prisms:
> - Large prism: $8 \times 6 \times 4 = 192$
> - Small prism: $4 \times 2 \times 4 = 32$
> - Total volume: $192 + 32 = 224$ cubic units

### **Type 4: Cross-Section Problems**
**Pattern**: Find area or perimeter of cross-section
**Key Concept**: Identify the shape of the cross-section

**Worked Example**:
> A cylinder is cut by a plane perpendicular to its axis. What is the area of the cross-section?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Cross-section is a circle with same radius as cylinder.
> If radius is $r$, then area = $\pi r^2$

### **Type 5: Scaling and Similarity**
**Pattern**: Find volume/surface area when dimensions are scaled
**Key Concept**: Volume scales by cube of factor, surface area by square of factor

**Worked Example**:
> A cube has side length 3. If all dimensions are doubled, what is the new volume?
> 
> **Solution**:
> Original volume: $3^3 = 27$
> Scaling factor: 2
> New volume: $27 \times 2^3 = 27 \times 8 = 216$

## üîç Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify the solid** and its type
2. **List given dimensions** and what you need to find
3. **Choose appropriate formula** for volume or surface area
4. **Substitute values** carefully
5. **Check units** and simplify

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Wrong formula** for the solid type
- **Missing the $\frac{1}{3}$ factor** in pyramid/cone volume
- **Incomplete surface area** calculations
- **Unit conversion errors**
- **Wrong cross-section** identification
