# 🧠 Problem-Solving Tips — Strategies & Heuristics

Actionable strategies and checklists for efficient AMC algebra problem solving.

## 🎯 How to Use This Section

### Before Contests
- **Review checklists** — Ensure you know all strategies
- **Practice decision trees** — Learn when to use each technique
- **Time yourself** — Build speed and efficiency

### During Contests
- **Follow checklists** — Don't skip steps
- **Use decision trees** — Choose the right approach
- **Manage time** — Don't get stuck on one problem

### Study Strategy
1. **Master basic strategies** — Domain first, extraneous solutions
2. **Practice advanced techniques** — Symmetry substitutions, discriminant playbook
3. **Build speed** — Time yourself on each strategy
4. **Review regularly** — Keep strategies fresh

## 📚 Strategy Categories

### 🔍 Problem Analysis
- **Domain first** — Check restrictions before manipulating
- **Extraneous solutions** — Always verify after squaring/cross-multiplying
- **Pattern recognition** — Look for common problem types

### 🎯 Solution Techniques
- **Symmetry substitutions** — Try $u=x+\frac{1}{x}$, $t=x^2$
- **Discriminant playbook** — Count roots, enforce conditions
- **Factor before expand** — Look for common patterns

### ⚡ Optimization
- **Sign and bounds** — Use AM-GM for lower bounds
- **Graph sense** — Visualize intersections and monotonicity
- **Timing strategies** — When to skip and move on

## 🎯 Quick Reference

| Strategy | When to Use | Key Points |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Domain First | Any equation with restrictions | Check denominators, radicands, log arguments |
| Extraneous Check | After squaring or cross-multiplying | Always substitute back into original |
| Symmetry Sub | Cyclic expressions, $x + \frac{1}{x}$ | Look for patterns that simplify |
| Discriminant | Parameter problems, root counting | Use $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ |
| Factor First | Complex expressions | Look for common factors before expanding |
| AM-GM | Optimization problems | Use for lower bounds on positive expressions |
| Graph Sense | Intersection problems | Visualize curves and their relationships |
| Time Management | All problems | Don't spend more than 3 minutes on one problem |

## ⚡ Contest Tips

### Time Management
- **Easy problems**: 1-2 minutes
- **Medium problems**: 3-5 minutes
- **Hard problems**: 5-8 minutes
- **Skip threshold**: 3 minutes without progress

### Problem Priority
1. **Factoring problems** — Usually quick wins
2. **Quadratic problems** — Well-practiced techniques
3. **System problems** — Good if you see the approach
4. **Advanced problems** — Time permitting

### Common Pitfalls
- **Domain errors** — Always check restrictions
- **Sign errors** — Watch negative signs carefully
- **Extraneous solutions** — Verify all answers
- **Time traps** — Don't get stuck on one problem
