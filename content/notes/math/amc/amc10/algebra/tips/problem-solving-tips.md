# 🧠 Problem-Solving Tips — Detailed Strategies

Comprehensive strategies for efficient AMC algebra problem solving.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] **Read the problem twice** — Understand what's being asked
- [ ] **Identify the type** — Factoring, equation solving, system, etc.
- [ ] **Check for restrictions** — Domain, range, parameter conditions
- [ ] **Look for patterns** — Common problem types or techniques

### Domain First Strategy
**When to use**: Any equation with fractions, radicals, or logarithms

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Denominators** — Set equal to zero, exclude those values
- [ ] **Radicands** — Must be non-negative for real solutions
- [ ] **Log arguments** — Must be positive
- [ ] **Write restrictions** — Note all excluded values

**Example**: Solve $\frac{x+1}{x-2} = \frac{x-3}{x+4}$
- Domain: $x \neq 2, -4$
- Cross-multiply: $(x+1)(x+4) = (x-3)(x-2)$
- Expand: $x^2 + 5x + 4 = x^2 - 5x + 6$
- Solve: $10x = 2$, so $x = \frac{1}{5}$
- Check: $\frac{1}{5} \neq 2, -4$ ✓

## 🎯 Solution Techniques

### Extraneous Solutions Strategy
**When to use**: After squaring both sides or cross-multiplying

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Identify the operation** — Squaring, cross-multiplying, etc.
- [ ] **Solve the equation** — Find all potential solutions
- [ ] **Substitute back** — Check each solution in original equation
- [ ] **Eliminate extraneous** — Remove solutions that don't work

**Example**: Solve $\sqrt{x+1} = x-1$
- Square both sides: $x+1 = (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1$
- Rearrange: $x^2 - 3x = 0$, so $x = 0, 3$
- Check $x = 0$: $\sqrt{1} = -1$ ✗ (extraneous)
- Check $x = 3$: $\sqrt{4} = 2$ ✓
- Answer: $x = 3$

### Symmetry Substitutions
**When to use**: Cyclic expressions, $x + \frac{1}{x}$, $x^2$ patterns

**Common substitutions**:
- [ ] **$u = x + \frac{1}{x}$** — For expressions involving $x$ and $\frac{1}{x}$
- [ ] **$t = x^2$** — For even powers of $x$
- [ ] **$u = x + k$** — To complete the square
- [ ] **$u = \sqrt{x}$** — For radical expressions

**Example**: Solve $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 7$
- Let $u = x + \frac{1}{x}$
- Then $u^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$, so $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = u^2 - 2$
- Equation becomes: $u^2 - 2 = 7$, so $u^2 = 9$, so $u = \pm 3$
- Solve $x + \frac{1}{x} = 3$: $x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$, so $x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$
- Solve $x + \frac{1}{x} = -3$: $x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0$, so $x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$

### Discriminant Playbook
**When to use**: Parameter problems, counting solutions

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Identify the equation** — Usually quadratic in form
- [ ] **Calculate discriminant** — $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$
- [ ] **Analyze cases** — $\Delta > 0$, $\Delta = 0$, $\Delta < 0$
- [ ] **Apply conditions** — What does the problem require?

**Example**: For what values of $k$ does $x^2 + kx + 1 = 0$ have no real solutions?
- Discriminant: $\Delta = k^2 - 4(1)(1) = k^2 - 4$
- No real solutions when $\Delta < 0$: $k^2 - 4 < 0$
- Solve: $k^2 < 4$, so $-2 < k < 2$

## ⚡ Optimization Strategies

### Factor Before Expand
**When to use**: Complex expressions, looking for patterns

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Look for common factors** — Factor out GCF first
- [ ] **Check for patterns** — Difference of squares, perfect squares, etc.
- [ ] **Group terms** — Look for grouping opportunities
- [ ] **Use identities** — Apply known factoring patterns

**Example**: Simplify $(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) - (x^2 - 1)^2$
- Factor out common factor: $(x^2 - 1)[(x^2 + 1) - (x^2 - 1)]$
- Simplify: $(x^2 - 1)(2) = 2(x^2 - 1) = 2(x-1)(x+1)$

### Sign and Bounds
**When to use**: Optimization problems, finding extrema

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Identify the expression** — What needs to be optimized?
- [ ] **Check for symmetry** — Look for even/odd patterns
- [ ] **Use AM-GM** — For positive expressions
- [ ] **Consider boundaries** — Check extreme values

**Example**: Find minimum value of $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$ for $x > 0$
- Use AM-GM: $\frac{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}}{2} \geq \sqrt{x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{x^2}} = 1$
- So $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \geq 2$
- Equality when $x^2 = \frac{1}{x^2}$, so $x = 1$
- Minimum value is $2$

## 🎯 Timing Strategies

### Time Allocation
- **Easy problems (1-2 minutes)**: Basic factoring, simple equations
- **Medium problems (3-5 minutes)**: Systems, quadratics, rational equations
- **Hard problems (5-8 minutes)**: Advanced techniques, parameter analysis
- **Skip threshold**: 3 minutes without progress

### Decision Tree
1. **Can I solve this quickly?** → Yes: Solve it
2. **Do I see a clear approach?** → Yes: Try it for 2-3 minutes
3. **Am I making progress?** → Yes: Continue for 1 more minute
4. **Still stuck?** → Skip and come back later

### Common Time Traps
- **Over-complicating** — Look for simple approaches first
- **Getting stuck** — Don't spend more than 3 minutes on one problem
- **Perfectionism** — Good enough is better than perfect
- **Second-guessing** — Trust your first approach if it's reasonable

## 📝 Practice Checklist

### Before Contests
- [ ] **Review all strategies** — Ensure you know them by heart
- [ ] **Practice decision trees** — Learn when to use each technique
- [ ] **Time yourself** — Build speed and efficiency
- [ ] **Review common pitfalls** — Avoid known mistakes

### During Contests
- [ ] **Follow checklists** — Don't skip steps
- [ ] **Use decision trees** — Choose the right approach
- [ ] **Manage time** — Don't get stuck on one problem
- [ ] **Stay calm** — Don't panic if you don't know something

### After Contests
- [ ] **Review mistakes** — Learn from errors
- [ ] **Identify weak areas** — Focus study on these
- [ ] **Practice more** — Build confidence and speed
- [ ] **Update strategies** — Refine your approach
