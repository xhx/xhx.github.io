# üó∫Ô∏è Concept Atlas ‚Äî Algebra Topic Overviews

Quick conceptual overviews of all algebra topics with AMC contest context.

## üî¢ Basic Operations

**Order of Operations (PEMDAS)** ‚Äî The foundation of all algebraic manipulation, ensuring consistent evaluation of expressions. Master parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (left-to-right), and addition/subtraction (left-to-right). **AMC appearance**: Often tested in "simplify this expression" problems where students make sign errors or misapply order.

**Factoring Patterns** ‚Äî Recognizing and applying standard algebraic identities like $(a \pm b)^2$, $a^2 - b^2$, and $a^3 \pm b^3$. These patterns appear everywhere in AMC problems, especially when simplifying complex expressions or solving equations. **AMC appearance**: Classic "factor completely" problems, often combined with other techniques like completing the square.

## üìà Linear Systems

**Linear Equations** ‚Äî Single-variable equations of the form $ax + b = 0$, fundamental building blocks for more complex systems. Master solving by isolation, and understand the connection between solutions and $x$-intercepts. **AMC appearance**: Often appear as setup problems for word problems, or as components of larger systems.

**Linear Inequalities** ‚Äî Extensions of linear equations using $<$, $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$. Critical to understand interval notation and graphing solutions. **AMC appearance**: "Find all values of $x$ such that..." problems, often combined with absolute value or rational expressions.

**Systems of Linear Equations** ‚Äî Multiple linear equations with multiple variables, solved by substitution or elimination. Essential for word problems involving multiple constraints. **AMC appearance**: Classic "two trains" problems, mixture problems, or geometric problems with multiple unknowns.

## üéØ Quadratic Systems

**Quadratic Equations** ‚Äî Second-degree equations $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, solved by factoring, completing the square, or quadratic formula. The discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the nature of roots. **AMC appearance**: Extremely common, often disguised in word problems or combined with other techniques.

**Parabolas & Vertex Form** ‚Äî Understanding $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ reveals vertex $(h,k)$ and axis of symmetry $x = h$. Essential for optimization problems and graphing. **AMC appearance**: "Find the maximum/minimum value" problems, often involving projectile motion or geometric optimization.

**Completing the Square** ‚Äî Technique to convert $ax^2 + bx + c$ to vertex form, revealing maximum/minimum values and symmetry. **AMC appearance**: Optimization problems, finding vertex coordinates, or solving certain quadratic equations.

## üßÆ Polynomial Theory

**Polynomial Division** ‚Äî Long division and synthetic division for polynomials, essential for understanding remainder and factor theorems. **AMC appearance**: AMC12 problems involving polynomial roots or remainders, often combined with Vieta's formulas.

**Remainder & Factor Theorems** ‚Äî If $f(a) = 0$, then $(x-a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. If $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$, remainder is $f(a)$. **AMC appearance**: "Find the remainder when..." or "factor this polynomial" problems, especially with given root information.

**Vieta's Formulas** ‚Äî Relationships between coefficients and roots: for $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, sum of roots is $-\frac{b}{a}$ and product is $\frac{c}{a}$. **AMC appearance**: Extremely common in AMC problems, often used to find relationships between roots without solving.

## üîÑ Rational & Radical

**Rational Expressions** ‚Äî Fractions with polynomial numerators and denominators, requiring domain restrictions and simplification techniques. **AMC appearance**: "Simplify this expression" problems, often involving complex fractions or partial fractions.

**Rational Equations** ‚Äî Equations involving rational expressions, solved by cross-multiplying and checking for extraneous solutions. **AMC appearance**: Word problems involving rates, proportions, or work problems, often with domain restrictions.

**Radical Equations** ‚Äî Equations with square roots or other radicals, solved by isolating and squaring both sides. **AMC appearance**: "Solve for $x$" problems, often involving Pythagorean theorem or distance formulas.

**Rational Exponents** ‚Äî Understanding $a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$ and applying exponent rules to fractional powers. **AMC appearance**: Simplification problems, often combined with logarithms or exponential equations.

## üé≤ Advanced Topics

**Systems of Nonlinear Equations** ‚Äî Systems involving quadratics, circles, or other curves, often solved by substitution. **AMC appearance**: Geometric problems involving intersections of curves, or optimization problems with constraints.

**Inequalities & Optimization** ‚Äî Using AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz, and other techniques to find bounds and extrema. **AMC appearance**: "Find the minimum/maximum value" problems, often involving symmetric expressions or geometric constraints.

**Sequences & Series** ‚Äî Arithmetic and geometric progressions, with formulas for terms and sums. Telescoping series for more advanced problems. **AMC appearance**: "Find the sum of..." problems, often involving large numbers or infinite series.

**Functional Equations** ‚Äî Equations involving unknown functions, often solved by substitution or exploiting symmetry. **AMC appearance**: AMC12 problems involving $f(x+a)$, $f(-x)$, or injectivity/surjectivity.

**Exponential & Logarithmic Equations** ‚Äî Equations involving $a^x$ and $\log_a x$, requiring careful application of log properties and domain restrictions. **AMC appearance**: Growth/decay problems, or equations involving different bases.

**Complex Numbers** ‚Äî Understanding $i^2 = -1$, conjugates, and modulus. Essential for AMC12 problems involving quadratic equations with complex roots. **AMC appearance**: "Find all solutions" problems, often involving quadratic equations or polynomial roots.

**Parameter Analysis** ‚Äî Analyzing how the number of solutions depends on parameter values, often using discriminant or other techniques. **AMC appearance**: "For what values of $k$ does this equation have..." problems, often involving tangency or intersection conditions.
