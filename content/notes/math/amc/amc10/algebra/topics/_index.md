# 📖 Topic Guides — Algebra Mastery

Detailed guides for each algebra topic, organized for systematic study.

## 🎯 Core Topics (AMC10 Essential)

### 🔢 Fundamentals
- **[Algebra Basics](../algebra-basics)** — Order of operations, factoring patterns, identities
- **[Linear Equations & Inequalities](../linear-equations-and-inequalities)** — One-variable, interval notation, graph sense

### 🎯 Quadratic Systems  
- **[Absolute Value](../absolute-value-equations-inequalities)** — Piecewise setup, distance view
- **[Quadratics & Parabolas](../quadratics-and-parabolas)** — Vertex/axis, discriminant, completing square

### 🧮 Polynomial Theory
- **[Polynomial Theory](../polynomial-theory)** — Division, remainder/factor theorems, Vieta

### 🔄 Rational & Radical
- **[Rational Expressions](../rational-expressions-and-equations)** — Domains, asymptote sense, extraneous roots
- **[Radicals & Exponents](../radicals-and-exponents)** — Rational exponents, conjugate/rationalize

### 🎲 Systems & Advanced
- **[Systems of Equations](../systems-of-equations)** — Substitution/elimination, 2×2, 3×3, nonlinear pairs
- **[Inequalities & Optimization](../inequalities-and-optimization)** — Sign charts, AM-GM/Cauchy, bounds
- **[Sequences & Recursions](../sequences-and-recursions)** — Arithmetic/geometric, simple recurrences, telescoping

## 🚀 Advanced Topics (AMC12 Extensions)

### 🧮 Advanced Algebra
