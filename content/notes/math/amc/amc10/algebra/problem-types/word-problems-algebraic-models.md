# üìù Word Problems ‚Äî Algebraic Models & Real-World Applications

Essential for translating real-world situations into algebraic equations and solving them.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

- **"How many"** ‚Äî Counting problems
- **"What is the ratio"** ‚Äî Ratio and proportion problems
- **"Work together"** ‚Äî Rate and work problems
- **"Mixture"** ‚Äî Mixture and concentration problems
- **"Age"** ‚Äî Age-related problems

## üìö Template Solutions

### Common Problem Types
| Type | Key Variables | Equation | Example |
|------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Work/Rate | $r = \frac{1}{t}$ (rate), $t$ (time) | $r_1 + r_2 = r_{\text{total}}$ | $A$ can do job in $3$ hours, $B$ in $6$ hours |
| Mixture | $c$ (concentration), $v$ (volume) | $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 = c_{\text{final}}v_{\text{final}}$ | Mix $20\%$ acid with $50\%$ acid |
| Age | $a$ (age now), $y$ (years ago) | $a - y = \text{age then}$ | "In $5$ years, John will be twice as old" |
| Distance | $d$ (distance), $r$ (rate), $t$ (time) | $d = rt$ | "Train travels $120$ miles in $2$ hours" |

### Translation Strategies
| Word/Phrase | Translation | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| "is" | $=$ | "John's age is $x$" ‚Üí $a = x$ |
| "more than" | $+$ | "$5$ more than $x$" ‚Üí $x + 5$ |
| "less than" | $-$ | "$3$ less than $x$" ‚Üí $x - 3$ |
| "times" | $\times$ | "$2$ times $x$" ‚Üí $2x$ |
| "of" | $\times$ | "$20\%$ of $x$" ‚Üí $0.2x$ |

## üéØ Worked Examples

### Example 1: Work/Rate Problem
**Problem**: Alice can paint a room in $4$ hours, and Bob can paint the same room in $6$ hours. How long will it take them to paint the room together?

**Solution**:
1. **Alice's rate**: $r_A = \frac{1}{4}$ rooms per hour
2. **Bob's rate**: $r_B = \frac{1}{6}$ rooms per hour
3. **Combined rate**: $r_{\text{total}} = r_A + r_B = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$
4. **Time together**: $t = \frac{1}{r_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4$ hours
5. **Answer**: $2.4$ hours (or $2$ hours $24$ minutes)

### Example 2: Mixture Problem
**Problem**: How many liters of a $20\%$ acid solution must be mixed with $5$ liters of a $50\%$ acid solution to get a $30\%$ acid solution?

**Solution**:
1. **Let $x$ = liters of $20\%$ solution**
2. **Set up equation**: $0.2x + 0.5(5) = 0.3(x + 5)$
3. **Simplify**: $0.2x + 2.5 = 0.3x + 1.5$
4. **Rearrange**: $2.5 - 1.5 = 0.3x - 0.2x$
5. **Solve**: $1 = 0.1x$ ‚Üí $x = 10$
6. **Answer**: $10$ liters

### Example 3: Age Problem
**Problem**: John is $3$ times as old as his son. In $5$ years, he will be twice as old as his son. How old is John now?

**Solution**:
1. **Let $s$ = son's age now, $j$ = John's age now**
2. **From first sentence**: $j = 3s$
3. **From second sentence**: $j + 5 = 2(s + 5)$
4. **Substitute**: $3s + 5 = 2s + 10$
5. **Solve**: $3s - 2s = 10 - 5$ ‚Üí $s = 5$
6. **Find John's age**: $j = 3(5) = 15$
7. **Answer**: John is $15$ years old

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall**: Incorrect variable setup
- **Fix**: Clearly define what each variable represents
- **Example**: "Let $x$ = number of apples" not "Let $x$ = apples"

**Pitfall**: Forgetting units
- **Fix**: Always include units in your answer
- **Example**: "$10$ liters" not just "$10$"

**Pitfall**: Incorrect equation setup
- **Fix**: Read the problem carefully and translate word by word
- **Example**: "John is $3$ times as old as his son" means $j = 3s$, not $s = 3j$

## üéØ AMC-Style Worked Example

**Problem**: A train leaves station A at $60$ mph and another train leaves station B at $80$ mph. If the stations are $280$ miles apart and the trains are traveling toward each other, how long will it take them to meet?

**Solution**:
1. **Let $t$ = time until they meet**
2. **Distance covered by first train**: $60t$ miles
3. **Distance covered by second train**: $80t$ miles
4. **Total distance**: $60t + 80t = 140t$ miles
5. **Set up equation**: $140t = 280$
6. **Solve**: $t = \frac{280}{140} = 2$ hours
7. **Answer**: $2$ hours

**Key insight**: When objects move toward each other, their distances add up to the total distance between them.
