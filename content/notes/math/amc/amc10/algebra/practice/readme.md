# ðŸ§® Algebra Practice Construction Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Construction Rules

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy (E)**: AMC10 Q1-10 level, basic techniques, straightforward calculations
- **Medium (M)**: AMC10 Q11-20 / AMC12 Q1-15 level, requires multiple steps or insight
- **Hard (H)**: AMC10 Q21-25 / AMC12 Q16-25 level, sophisticated techniques or clever insights

### Topic Coverage Matrix

| Topic | Mixed Sets | Topic Drills | Mock Exams |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Factoring & Identities | 15% | 100% (factoring) | 12% |
| Quadratics & Discriminant | 20% | 100% (quadratics) | 20% |
| Rational Equations | 15% | 100% (rational) | 12% |
| Absolute Value | 10% | 100% (abs-value) | 8% |
| Systems of Equations | 15% | 100% (systems) | 16% |
| Sequences & Series | 10% | 100% (sequences) | 12% |
| Exponents & Logs | 10% | 100% (exponents) | 12% |
| Radicals & Conjugates | 5% | 100% (radicals) | 8% |

### Choice Distribution
- Aim for roughly equal distribution of correct answers (A, B, C, D, E)
- Avoid long runs of the same letter
- Include plausible distractors based on common errors

### Solution Guidelines
- Keep solutions concise (one screen maximum)
- Highlight the key AMC technique or insight
- Include brief pitfall warnings when relevant
- Show alternative methods if significantly different

## ðŸŽ¯ Source Attribution

- **Original AMC**: `source: AMC10 YYYY #NN` or `source: AMC12 YYYY #NN`
- **AMC-style**: `source: Original (AMC-style)`
- **AMC12-leaning**: `source: Original (AMC12-leaning)`

## ðŸ“Š Set Construction

### Mixed Sets (25 questions)
- Q1-10: Easy level, basic algebra skills
- Q11-20: Medium level, multi-step problems
- Q21-25: Hard level, advanced techniques

### Topic Drills (12 questions)
- 4 Easy â†’ 5 Medium â†’ 3 Hard
- Focus on specific sub-patterns within each topic
- Cover all major problem types for that topic

### Mock Exams
- Full 25-question format
- Realistic difficulty distribution
- Time pressure simulation (75 minutes)
