# ðŸŽ² Counting & Probability Practice Construction Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Construction Rules

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy (E)**: AMC10 Q1-10 level, basic counting principles, simple probability
- **Medium (M)**: AMC10 Q11-20 / AMC12 Q1-15 level, requires casework or complementary counting
- **Hard (H)**: AMC10 Q21-25 / AMC12 Q16-25 level, sophisticated techniques like PIE or generating functions

### Topic Coverage Matrix

| Topic | Mixed Sets | Topic Drills | Mock Exams |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Permutations & Combinations | 25% | 100% (perm-comb) | 24% |
| Stars & Bars | 15% | 100% (stars-bars) | 12% |
| Pigeonhole & PIE | 15% | 100% (pigeonhole) | 16% |
| Grid Paths & Arrangements | 20% | 100% (grid-paths) | 20% |
| Probability Basics & EV | 15% | 100% (probability) | 16% |
| Geometric Probability | 10% | 100% (geo-prob) | 12% |

### Choice Distribution
- Aim for roughly equal distribution of correct answers (A, B, C, D, E)
- Avoid long runs of the same letter
- Include plausible distractors based on common counting errors

### Solution Guidelines
- Keep solutions concise (one screen maximum)
- Highlight the key counting technique (complementary counting, PIE, etc.)
- Include brief pitfall warnings when relevant
- Show alternative counting methods if significantly different

## ðŸŽ¯ Source Attribution

- **Original AMC**: `source: AMC10 YYYY #NN` or `source: AMC12 YYYY #NN`
- **AMC-style**: `source: Original (AMC-style)`
- **AMC12-leaning**: `source: Original (AMC12-leaning)`

## ðŸ“Š Set Construction

### Mixed Sets (25 questions)
- Q1-10: Easy level, basic counting and probability
- Q11-20: Medium level, casework and complementary counting
- Q21-25: Hard level, advanced techniques

### Topic Drills (12 questions)
- 4 Easy â†’ 5 Medium â†’ 3 Hard
- Focus on specific sub-patterns within each topic
- Cover all major problem types for that topic

### Mock Exams
- Full 25-question format
- Realistic difficulty distribution
- Time pressure simulation (75 minutes)
