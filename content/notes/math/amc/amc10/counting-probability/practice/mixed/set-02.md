How many ways can 5 people sit in a row?

A) $24$
B) $60$
C) $120$
D) $240$
E) $720$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>This is $5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$ ways.</p>
</details>

### 2.

A committee of 3 is to be chosen from 8 people. How many ways can this be done?

A) $24$
B) $56$
C) $120$
D) $336$
E) $512$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>This is $\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 56$.</p>
</details>

### 3.

What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice?

A) $\frac{1}{6}$
B) $\frac{1}{9}$
C) $\frac{1}{12}$
D) $\frac{1}{18}$
E) $\frac{1}{36}$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>The favorable outcomes are $(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)$, which is 6 out of 36 total outcomes, so $\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$.</p>
</details>

### 4.
