## 🎯 Legend

- **✅ Core**: Essential for this level, appears frequently
- **✅ Often**: Important but less frequent, good to know
- **⚠️ Stretch**: Advanced topic, appears occasionally
- **❌ No**: Not tested at this level

## 📊 Study Priorities

### AMC 10 Focus
1. **Basic counting principles** (addition, multiplication, complement)
2. **Permutations and combinations** (with and without repetition)
3. **Basic probability** (fractions, conditional, independence)
4. **Common problem types** (seating, words, committees, grids)

### AMC 12 Focus
1. **Everything from AMC 10** (assumed knowledge)
2. **Advanced counting** (inclusion-exclusion, pigeonhole, stars and bars)
3. **Expected value and linearity**
4. **Probability distributions** (binomial, geometric, hypergeometric)
5. **Advanced problem types** (derangements, complex probability chains)

## 🚀 Contest Strategy

- **AMC 10**: Master the "Core" and "Often" topics, skip "Stretch"
- **AMC 12**: Cover all "Core" and "Often" topics, study "Stretch" for harder problems
- **Time allocation**: Focus 80% of study time on "Core" topics for your level
