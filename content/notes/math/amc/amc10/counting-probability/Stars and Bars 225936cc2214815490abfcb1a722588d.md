# Stars and Bars

### Find the number of ways to distribute $n$ identical objects to $k$ people.

The **Stars and Bars** method is a combinatorial technique used to solve problems that involve distributing indistinguishable objects (like stars) into distinguishable groups (like bins). It helps find the number of ways to solve equations where the variables represent non-negative or positive integers.

### 1. **Positive Integer Solutions:**

Theorem: The number of positive integer solutions to the equation:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n
\]

is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]

### Explanation:

- The variables \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k\) represent the number of objects in each group, and we need each variable to be a positive integer (\(x_i \geq 1\)).
- To transform this into a stars and bars problem, we make a substitution: let \( y_i = x_i - 1 \), where \( y_i \geq 0 \). Now, the equation becomes:

\[
(y_1 + 1) + (y_2 + 1) + \dots + (y_k + 1) = n,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
y_1 + y_2 + \dots + y_k = n - k
\]

Now, we need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to this new equation. The number of ways to place \( k-1 \) "bars" between \( n-k \) stars is given by:

\[
\binom{(n-k) + (k-1)}{k-1} = \binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]

This is the number of ways to distribute \(n\) units among \(k\) groups where each group gets at least 1 unit.

### 2. **Non-Negative Integer Solutions:**

Theorem: The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n
\]

is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
\]

### Explanation:

- The variables \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k\) represent the number of objects in each group, and we allow \(x_i \geq 0\).
- This is a classic stars and bars problem, where we are dividing \(n\) indistinguishable objects (stars) into \(k\) distinguishable groups (bins). The number of ways to do this is equivalent to placing \(k-1\) "bars" between \(n\) stars.
- The total number of symbols (stars and bars) is \(n + (k-1)\), and we need to choose \(k-1\) positions for the bars.

Thus, the number of solutions is:

\[
\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
\]

This counts the number of ways to distribute \(n\) units among \(k\) groups, where any group can receive zero or more units.

### Summary:

- **For positive integer solutions:** The number of solutions to \(x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n\) where each \(x_i \geq 1\) is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]

- **For non-negative integer solutions:** The number of solutions to \(x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n\) where each \(x_i \geq 0\) is:

\[
\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
\]

The Stars and Bars method provides a powerful way to count distributions in combinatorics, especially in problems involving partitions and groupings.
