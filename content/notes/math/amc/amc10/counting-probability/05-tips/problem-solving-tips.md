# üß† Problem-Solving Tips

Comprehensive heuristics, checklists, and strategies for solving AMC counting and probability problems efficiently.

## üéØ Recognition Strategies

### Quick Problem Type Identification
- **"How many ways"** ‚Üí Counting problem
- **"What's the probability"** ‚Üí Probability problem
- **"At least/at most"** ‚Üí Complement counting or inclusion-exclusion
- **"Sit together"** ‚Üí Adjacency problem
- **"Around a table"** ‚Üí Circular arrangement
- **"Without replacement"** ‚Üí Hypergeometric distribution
- **"With replacement"** ‚Üí Binomial distribution

### Constraint Analysis
- **Adjacency**: Use gaps method or treat as unit
- **Spacing**: Use gaps method
- **Fixed positions**: Fix first, arrange the rest
- **Gender/role restrictions**: Count separately for each group
- **At least/at most**: Use complement counting

### Symmetry Detection
- **Equal probability**: All outcomes equally likely
- **Symmetric positions**: Equivalent positions in arrangement
- **Symmetric choices**: Equivalent choices in selection

## üîß Solution Techniques

### Complement Counting
- **When to use**: "At least" or "at most" problems
- **How to apply**: Total - Unwanted cases
- **Example**: "At least one head" = Total - "No heads"

### Casework Discipline
- **Organize by**: Constraint type, not by individual cases
- **Avoid**: Overcounting by double-counting cases
- **Check**: That all cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive

### Indicator Variables
- **When to use**: Expected count problems
- **How to apply**: Define $I_i$ = 1 if event occurs in trial $i$, 0 otherwise
- **Key insight**: $\mathbb{E}[\text{total count}] = \sum_i \mathbb{E}[I_i]$

### Symmetry Principles
- **Equal probability**: $P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$
- **Symmetric positions**: Use relative positions
- **Symmetric choices**: Use relative probabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Overcounting Alarms
- **Warning signs**: Answer seems too large, double-counting cases
- **Prevention**: Use systematic casework, check for overlaps
- **Fix**: Use inclusion-exclusion or more careful counting

### Indistinguishable Items
- **Warning signs**: Objects that look the same
- **Prevention**: Check if objects are truly identical
- **Fix**: Divide by factorials of repeated objects

### Replacement Confusion
- **Warning signs**: "Drawing" or "selecting" without specifying replacement
- **Prevention**: Always check if replacement is mentioned
- **Fix**: Use appropriate distribution (binomial vs. hypergeometric)

### Circular vs. Linear
- **Warning signs**: "Around a table" vs. "in a line"
- **Prevention**: Read the problem carefully
- **Fix**: Use $(n-1)!$ for circular, $n!$ for linear

### Order Matters
- **Warning signs**: "Arrange" vs. "choose"
- **Prevention**: Check if order is important
- **Fix**: Use permutations for arrangements, combinations for selections

## üèÜ Contest Strategy

### Time Management
- **Easy problems**: 2-3 minutes each
- **Medium problems**: 5-7 minutes each
- **Hard problems**: 10-15 minutes each
- **Skip strategy**: If stuck for 5+ minutes, move on

### Problem Prioritization
1. **Start with**: Problems you recognize immediately
2. **Second pass**: Problems you can solve with standard techniques
3. **Third pass**: Problems requiring creative approaches
4. **Last resort**: Problems you're unsure about

### Answer Verification
- **Sanity checks**: Does the answer make sense?
- **Unit checks**: Are you counting the right thing?
- **Range checks**: Is the answer in a reasonable range?
- **Symmetry checks**: Does the answer respect symmetry?

## üìã Problem-Solving Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Read the problem carefully
- [ ] Identify the problem type
- [ ] Note all constraints
- [ ] Check for symmetry

### During Solving
- [ ] Choose the right method
- [ ] Apply constraints correctly
- [ ] Check for overcounting
- [ ] Verify each step

### After Solving
- [ ] Check the answer makes sense
- [ ] Verify units and range
- [ ] Consider alternative methods
- [ ] Double-check calculations

## üéØ Level-Specific Tips

### AMC 10 Focus
- **Master basics**: Permutations, combinations, simple probability
- **Use symmetry**: When all outcomes are equally likely
- **Avoid complexity**: Don't overthink simple problems
- **Practice speed**: Focus on quick recognition and solution

### AMC 12 Focus
- **Advanced techniques**: Inclusion-exclusion, expected value, distributions
- **Complex constraints**: Multiple overlapping conditions
- **Creative approaches**: When standard methods don't work
- **Deep understanding**: Know why formulas work, not just how to use them

## üîÑ Common Problem Patterns

### Seating Problems
1. **Identify**: Adjacency, spacing, or fixed position constraints
2. **Apply**: Gaps method for spacing, treat as unit for adjacency
3. **Check**: Circular vs. linear, reflection symmetry

### Word Problems
1. **Identify**: Letter arrangements with constraints
2. **Apply**: Multinomial coefficients for repeated letters
3. **Check**: Adjacency constraints, position requirements

### Committee Problems
1. **Identify**: Selection with role or gender constraints
2. **Apply**: Combinations for unordered, permutations for ordered
3. **Check**: At least/at most constraints

### Probability Problems
1. **Identify**: With/without replacement, independence
2. **Apply**: Appropriate distribution (binomial, hypergeometric, etc.)
3. **Check**: Conditional probability, total probability

## üöÄ Advanced Strategies

### When Stuck
1. **Try small cases**: Work with $n=2,3,4$ first
2. **Use symmetry**: Look for equivalent cases
3. **Complement approach**: Count what you don't want
4. **Indicators**: Use linearity of expectation
5. **Recursion**: Break into smaller subproblems

### Time-Saving Techniques
1. **Memorize common formulas**: Don't derive every time
2. **Use symmetry**: Avoid unnecessary casework
3. **Complement counting**: Often faster than direct counting
4. **Indicators**: Avoid complex probability calculations
5. **Pattern recognition**: Learn to spot common problem types
