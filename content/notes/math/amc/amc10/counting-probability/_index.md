## 🏆 Contest Strategy

- **AMC 10**: Focus on basic counting, simple probability, and fundamental formulas
- **AMC 12**: Add advanced topics like generating functions, complex probability distributions
- **Time Management**: Use symmetry and complement principles to avoid casework
- **Common Traps**: Watch for indistinguishable objects, circular arrangements, and replacement vs. no-replacement
