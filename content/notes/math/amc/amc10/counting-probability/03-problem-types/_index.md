# 🧩 Problem Types

A comprehensive catalog of common AMC counting and probability problem patterns with recognition cues and solution templates.

## 📚 Problem Type Overview

### 🔢 Basic Counting Patterns
- **[Seating & Restrictions](seatings-restrictions)** - Adjacency and spacing problems
- **[Word Rearrangements](word-rearrangements)** - Letter arrangements with constraints
- **[Committees & Conditions](committees-and-conditions)** - Selection with roles and constraints
- **[Balls in Bins](balls-in-bins)** - Integer solutions and distribution problems

### 🎯 Advanced Counting Patterns
- **[At Least/At Most](at-least-at-most)** - Complement and inclusion-exclusion strategies
- **[Grid Paths](grid-paths)** - Lattice walks with restrictions
- **[Circular Permutations](circular-permutations)** - Ring arrangements and reflections
- **[Derangements](derangements)** - No element in original position

### 🎲 Probability Patterns
- **[Urn, Coin & String Problems](urn-coin-strings)** - Replacement vs. no-replacement
- **[Expected Counts](expected-counts)** - Indicator variables and linearity
- **[Conditional Chains](conditional-chains)** - Total probability and Bayes
- **[Symmetry Probability](symmetry-probability)** - Random choices via symmetry

### 🔍 Specialized Patterns
- **[Hypergeo vs Binomial](hypergeo-vs-binomial)** - Distribution recognition
- **[Digit Counting](digit-counting)** - Divisibility and base representations

## 🎯 How to Use This Section

1. **Recognition**: Learn the cues that identify each problem type
2. **Template**: Follow the solution template for each type
3. **Practice**: Work through the AMC-style examples
4. **Pitfalls**: Study common mistakes and how to avoid them

## 📊 Problem Type Matrix

| Problem Type | AMC 10 | AMC 12 | Key Technique |
|--------------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Seating & Restrictions | ✅ Core | ✅ Core | Adjacency method |
| Word Rearrangements | ✅ Core | ✅ Core | Permutations with repetition |
| Committees & Conditions | ✅ Core | ✅ Core | Combinations with constraints |
| Balls in Bins | ⚠️ Stretch | ✅ Often | Stars and bars |
| At Least/At Most | ⚠️ Stretch | ✅ Often | Complement counting |
| Grid Paths | ✅ Often | ✅ Core | Lattice path counting |
| Circular Permutations | ⚠️ Stretch | ✅ Often | $(n-1)!$ formula |
| Derangements | ❌ No | ✅ Stretch | Inclusion-exclusion |
| Expected Counts | ❌ No | ✅ Often | Linearity of expectation |
| Conditional Chains | ⚠️ Stretch | ✅ Often | Total probability |

## 🏆 Contest Strategy

- **AMC 10**: Focus on basic counting patterns and simple probability
- **AMC 12**: Master all patterns, especially advanced counting and probability
- **Recognition**: Practice identifying problem types quickly
- **Templates**: Memorize solution approaches for common types
