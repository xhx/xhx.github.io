# 📚 AMC 10/12 — Exam Syllabus

A streamlined, **what-you-actually-see** syllabus for AMC 10/12. It lists **AMC 10 core** topics and the **few key additions** for AMC 12 (mainly **logarithms, trigonometry, complex numbers**) plus light extensions of AMC 10 tools.

> ✅ Use this as your planning backbone. If a topic isn’t listed here, it’s likely **AIME-level** or too rare for AMC 10/12.

## 🧮 Algebra & Functions (Core for AMC 10)

### 1) Linear & Quadratic
- Factor/expand, complete the square; vertex/intercepts/axis; discriminant sense.
- Viète (sum/product of roots), quick parameter checks.

### 2) Polynomials
- Remainder/Factor theorems; basic Vieta relations; synthetic division when natural.
- Classic identities: $(a\pm b)^2$, $a^2-b^2$, $a^3\pm b^3$, $(a+b)^3$.

### 3) Rational Expressions & Equations
- **Domain first**; cancellation rules; avoid/spot **extraneous solutions**.

### 4) Inequalities & Absolute Value
- Sign charts; piecewise splitting; **AM–GM** for quick bounds (light use).

### 5) Systems
- Substitution/elimination for linear; simple nonlinear pairs (e.g., line–circle).

### 6) Exponents & Radicals
- Laws of exponents; rational exponents; conjugate/rationalize tactics.

### 7) Sequences & Series
- AP/GP formulas; finite/infinite GP; simple telescoping sums.

### 8) Functions
- Composition/inverses; graph transformations; piecewise; light functional-equation plugging for symmetry/fixed points.

#### AMC 12 Adds in Algebra
- **Logarithms**: $\log$ laws, change-of-base, solving equations/inequalities, growth comparisons.
- More discriminant/parameter sweeps (counting roots, tangency conditions).

## 📐 Geometry (Core for AMC 10)

### 1) Triangles
- Similarity & congruence (SSS/SAS/ASA/AAS); area: $A=\tfrac12 ab\sin C$, **Heron**.
- Special points: centroid, incenter, circumcenter, orthocenter (basic properties).

### 2) Circles & Cyclic Figures
- Central/inscribed angles; chord–tangent–secant relations; **Power of a Point**.
- Cyclic quadrilaterals: opposite angles supplementary; equal angles $\leftrightarrow$ equal arcs.

### 3) Coordinate Geometry
- Slope, distance, midpoint; line & circle equations; collinearity/concurrency via algebra.
- **Shoelace** for polygon area.

### 4) Transformations & 3D Basics
- Reflections/rotations/translations; symmetry arguments.
- 3D volumes/surfaces (prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, spheres), nets & cross-sections; space diagonal.

#### AMC 12 Adds in Geometry
- **Trig toolkit**: unit circle values, identities (Pythagorean, angle addition/double/half), basic trig equations.
- **Law of sines/cosines**, $A=\tfrac12 ab\sin C$ as an algebraic lever.
- Slightly deeper cyclic/similarity chains (still AMC-level).

## 🎲 Counting & Probability (Core for AMC 10)

### 1) Counting Principles & P&C
- Sum/product rules; complement; with/without repetition; indistinguishable objects; circular basics.

### 2) Stars & Bars / PIE / Pigeonhole
- Nonnegative/positive solutions; simple bounds/caps.
- **PIE up to 3 sets**; **Pigeonhole** classic bounds and constructions.

### 3) Classic Patterns
- Grid paths; anagrams; seatings with restrictions (gaps/adjacency); committees with conditions.

### 4) Probability & Expected Value
- Sample space models; conditional probability; independence checks.
- **Linearity of expectation**; **indicator variables** (expected counts).  
- Binomial/Geometric recognition; simple **Hypergeometric** selections.

#### AMC 12 Adds in C&P
- Slightly richer PIE/bounds; **derangements**; more geometric probability setups.

## 🔢 Number Theory (Core for AMC 10)

### 1) Divisibility & GCD/LCM
- Euclidean algorithm; $\gcd\!\cdot\!\operatorname{lcm}=\text{product}$; prime factorization.

### 2) Modular Arithmetic
- Residues; modular inverses when $\gcd=1$; last-digit cycles; reduce big exponents.
- Quick use of **Fermat/Euler** to tame powers.

### 3) CRT & Simple Diophantine
- **CRT** with small pairwise coprime moduli; solve two-mod systems.
- Linear forms $ax+by=c$, coin problems (two-coin Frobenius by recognition).

### 4) Digits & Bases

## 🎯 Study Flow (Practical)

1. **Master AMC 10 Core** in all four domains (Algebra, Geometry, C&P, Number Theory).  
2. Layer **AMC 12 Adds**: **Logs, Trig, Complex** (plus light extensions in each domain).  
3. Drill **pattern recognition**: grid paths, stars & bars, PIE ≤ 3 sets, power-of-a-point, discriminant sweeps, modular cycles.  
4. After each practice set: **error review** → log the miss reason (concept vs. slip vs. strategy).  
5. Weekly checkpoint: 1 short mixed section (25–35 min) focusing on **timing + accuracy**.

## 🧩 Micro-Checklist Before Test Day
- **Domains covered**: Algebra ✔︎ Geometry ✔︎ Counting/Prob ✔︎ Number Theory ✔︎ (+ Logs/Trig/Complex for AMC 12).  
- **Tools ready**: factor/identity bank, PoP & cyclic cues, stars-bars/PIE/pigeonhole, modular inverse/CRT.  
- **Habits**: domain first (for rational/log/radical), verify after squaring/cross-multiplying, check units/signs/extremes, use complement/linearity.

> Keep it simple: nail the core, add logs/trig/complex, practice patterns, and review mistakes with discipline.
