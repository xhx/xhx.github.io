# üß† General Problem Solving Strategies

- Working backwards
- Guess and check
- Logical deduction
- Estimation
- Pattern recognition
- Symmetry and invariants

# Usage Tips for Students

- The single biggest score-boost comes from mastering Algebra-Geometry crossover problems: think of a diagram then translate to equations, or vice-versa.
- Nearly every AMC 10 has 1‚Äì2 questions solvable in ‚â§ 30 s by clever bounding or parity arguments; practice spotting them.
- Practice compound topics: e.g., count lattice points in/on a circle (Geometry + Number Theory + Combinatorics).
- Build fluency with standard algebraic identities and triangle theorems‚Äîthese are the ‚Äúmultiplication tables‚Äù of AMC work.
- In Geometry Problems
    
    ‚Äì Draw a diagram for all the problems
    ‚Äì Estimate the dimensions if you don‚Äôt have enough time
    ‚Äì If something looks the same to you (such as 2 side lengths), then it probably
    is the same (Note: Only use this tip if you don‚Äôt have enough time)
    

### Some tricks:

1. Engineer‚Äôs induction -  trying small numbers and noticing a pattern
2. Try to find unique properties of numbers
    1. Unit‚Äôs Digit
    2. Last 2 digits
    3. Parity (odd, even)
    4. Square / not square
    5. Prime / composite
    6. Modulus (divisible by 3, 4, 5 etc)
3. Look for the choices that are different from all others
4. Try all option choices
5. Estimate the answer (especially useful for Geometry)
6. Elimination of Choices
7. When given freedom in parts of the problems, assume a certain thing is true
