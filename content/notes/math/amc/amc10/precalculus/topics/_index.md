# 🧭 Topic Guides

Detailed study guides for each major precalculus topic, designed specifically for AMC preparation. Each guide includes key concepts, examples, common traps, and AMC-style problems.

## 📚 Core Topics (AMC 10 & 12)

### 🔄 [Functions & Transformations](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/functions-and-transformations)
Domains, ranges, inverses, shifts, scales, and symmetry. Essential foundation for all function work.

### 📊 [Equations & Inequalities](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/equations-and-inequalities)
Absolute value equations, systems, and basic inequality techniques including AM-GM.

### 🎯 [Polynomials & Rational Functions](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/polynomials-and-rational-functions)
Factoring, Vieta's formulas, asymptotes, and partial fractions.

### 🔢 [Exponents & Logarithms](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/exponents-and-logarithms)
Laws, change-of-base, equation solving, and growth/decay applications.

### 📐 [Trigonometry Basics](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/trigonometry-basics)
Unit circle, special angles, and right triangle relationships.

### 🔄 [Trig Identities & Equations](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/trig-identities-and-equations)
Addition formulas, double/half angles, and equation solving techniques.

### 📐 [Laws of Sines & Cosines](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/laws-of-sines-and-cosines)
Triangle solving, area calculations, and the ambiguous case.

## 🎯 Advanced Topics (AMC 12 Focus)

### 🌀 [Complex Numbers](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/complex-numbers)
Algebra, polar form, De Moivre's theorem, and roots of unity.

### 🌀 [Complex Plane Geometry](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/complex-plane-geometry)
Rotations, loci, and geometric applications in the complex plane.

### 📈 [Sequences & Series](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/sequences-and-series)
Arithmetic, geometric, telescoping, and partial sums.

### 🎯 [Binomial Theorem & Series](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/binomial-theorem-and-series)
Expansions, coefficients, and estimation techniques.

### 📐 [Coordinate Geometry](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/coordinate-geometry)
Lines, circles, distance, and basic conic sections.

### 🎯 [Vectors (Light)](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/vectors-light)
2D vectors, dot product, and projections.

### 🔄 [Functional Equations (Light)](/notes/math/amc/amc10/precalculus/topics/functional-equations-light)
Substitutions, invariants, and common patterns.

## 🎯 Study Strategy

1. **Start with Core Topics** - Master the fundamentals first
2. **Practice with Examples** - Work through each topic's examples
3. **Watch for Traps** - Pay attention to common pitfalls
4. **Apply to AMC Problems** - Use the worked examples as templates
5. **Connect Topics** - See how different areas work together
