B) $50$
C) $55$
D) $60$
E) $65$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>Using the formula: Sum = n(n+1)/2 = 10(11)/2 = 55.</p>
</details>

### 8.
*Tags: Geometric Formula · Medium · source: Original (AMC-style)*

What is the sum of 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81?

A) $100$
B) $121$
C) $130$
D) $140$
E) $150$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>This is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 3. Sum = 1(3⁵-1)/(3-1) = (243-1)/2 = 121.</p>
</details>

### 9.
*Tags: Telescoping · Medium · source: Original (AMC-style)*

What is the sum of 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/20?

A) $1/4$
B) $1/3$
C) $1/2$
D) $2/3$
E) $3/4$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: E</strong></p>
<p>Using telescoping: 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/20 = (1-1/2) + (1/2-1/3) + (1/3-1/4) + (1/4-1/5) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.</p>
</details>

### 10.
