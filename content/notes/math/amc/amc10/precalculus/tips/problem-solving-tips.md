## üîç Pattern Recognition Guide

### **Function Problems**
**Look for**: $f(x)$, domains, ranges, inverses, composition
**Common patterns**:
- Domain restrictions (square roots, logarithms, fractions)
- Function composition $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$
- Inverse functions $f^{-1}(x)$ vs $\frac{1}{f(x)}$
- Transformations (shifts, scales, reflections)

**Example**: "Find domain of $\sqrt{\log_2(x-1)}$"
**Pattern**: Nested domain restrictions
**Strategy**: Work from inside out

### **Polynomial Problems**
**Look for**: Roots, coefficients, Vieta's relationships
**Common patterns**:
- Vieta's formulas for root relationships
- Remainder theorem for polynomial division
- Factoring techniques (difference of squares, sum/difference of cubes)
- Symmetric sum identities

**Example**: "If $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ has roots $r$ and $s$, find $r^2 + s^2$"
**Pattern**: Vieta's + symmetric sum identity
**Strategy**: Use $r^2 + s^2 = (r+s)^2 - 2rs$

### **Trigonometric Problems**
**Look for**: $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, angles, identities
**Common patterns**:
- Unit circle values for special angles
- Identity manipulation (Pythagorean, addition, double angle)
- Law of sines and cosines for triangles
- Inverse trigonometric functions

**Example**: "Solve $\sin(2x) = \cos(x)$ for $0 \leq x < 2\pi$"
**Pattern**: Multiple trig functions
**Strategy**: Use double angle formula, then factor

### **Logarithm/Exponential Problems**
**Look for**: $\log$, $\ln$, $e^x$, growth/decay
**Common patterns**:
- Logarithm laws (product, quotient, power)
- Change of base formula
- Domain restrictions (arguments must be positive)
- Growth and decay applications

**Example**: "Solve $\log_2(x-1) + \log_2(x+1) = 3$"
**Pattern**: Multiple logarithms
**Strategy**: Combine using product law, check domain

### **Complex Number Problems**
**Look for**: $i$, polar form, rotations, roots of unity
**Common patterns**:
- Polar form $z = re^{i\theta}$
- De Moivre's theorem for powers
- Roots of unity forming regular polygons
- Geometric interpretations in complex plane

**Example**: "Find all complex numbers $z$ such that $z^3 = -8$"
**Pattern**: Roots of complex numbers
**Strategy**: Convert to polar form, use De Moivre's

### **Sequence/Series Problems**
**Look for**: $a_n$, $S_n$, arithmetic, geometric, telescoping
**Common patterns**:
- Arithmetic sequences: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
- Geometric sequences: $a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}$
- Telescoping series with cancellation
- Binomial theorem for expansions

**Example**: "Find sum of first 20 terms of arithmetic sequence with $a_1 = 3$ and $d = 4$"
**Pattern**: Arithmetic sequence sum
**Strategy**: Use $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$

### **Coordinate Geometry Problems**
**Look for**: Points, distances, areas, conic sections
**Common patterns**:
- Distance formula and midpoint formula
- Line equations (point-slope, slope-intercept)
- Circle equations and properties
- Area formulas (triangle, polygon)

**Example**: "Find area of triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,4)$, $(6,0)$"
**Pattern**: Triangle area calculation
**Strategy**: Use coordinate geometry area formula

### **Inequality Problems**
**Look for**: Maximum/minimum, optimization, AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz
**Common patterns**:
- AM-GM inequality for optimization
- Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for dot products
- Constrained optimization problems
- Equality conditions

**Example**: "Find minimum of $x + \frac{1}{x}$ for $x > 0$"
**Pattern**: AM-GM optimization
**Strategy**: Apply AM-GM to $x$ and $\frac{1}{x}$

## ‚è∞ Timing Strategy

## üö® Common Traps & How to Avoid Them

### **Domain/Range Traps**
**Trap**: Forgetting domain restrictions
**Fix**: Always check domains for square roots, logarithms, fractions
**Example**: $\sqrt{x-2} + \log(x+1)$ requires $x \geq 2$ and $x > -1$ ‚Üí $x \geq 2$

### **Sign Traps**
**Trap**: Wrong signs in formulas
**Fix**: Double-check signs in Vieta's formulas, trig identities
**Example**: Sum of roots = $-\frac{b}{a}$, not $\frac{b}{a}$

### **Extraneous Solution Traps**
**Trap**: Solutions that don't work in original equation
**Fix**: Always check solutions, especially after squaring
**Example**: Squaring both sides of $\sqrt{x} = x-2$ can introduce extraneous solutions

### **Unit Traps**
**Trap**: Confusing degrees and radians
**Fix**: Be consistent with units throughout the problem
**Example**: $\sin 30¬∞ = \frac{1}{2}$, but $\sin 30$ (radians) ‚âà $-0.988$

### **Notation Traps**
**Trap**: Confusing similar notations
**Fix**: Be careful with $f^{-1}(x)$ vs $\frac{1}{f(x)}$, $\log_a(xy)$ vs $\log_a x \cdot \log_a y$
**Example**: $f^{-1}(x)$ is inverse function, $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is reciprocal

## üìä Strategic Guessing

### **Elimination Strategy**
1. **Read all choices** - Don't just pick the first reasonable answer
2. **Eliminate obviously wrong** - Use domain restrictions, common sense
3. **Test boundary cases** - Check extreme values
4. **Use symmetry** - Look for patterns in the choices

### **Estimation Strategy**
1. **Round numbers** - Use approximations for complex calculations
2. **Check orders of magnitude** - Make sure your answer is reasonable
3. **Use known values** - Leverage special angles, common log values
4. **Compare to similar problems** - Use previous experience

### **Pattern Recognition in Choices**
1. **Look for relationships** - Do choices follow a pattern?
2. **Check for symmetry** - Are there pairs of similar answers?
3. **Use the problem structure** - Does the answer format match the question?
4. **Consider special cases** - What happens at boundaries?
