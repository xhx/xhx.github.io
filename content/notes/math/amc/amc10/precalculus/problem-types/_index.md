# üß© Problem Types

Master the art of pattern recognition! This section provides templates and strategies for common AMC precalculus problem types.

## üéØ Pattern Recognition Strategy

1. **Read the problem** - What's being asked?
2. **Identify the pattern** - Which type does this match?
3. **Apply the template** - Use the standard approach
4. **Check your work** - Verify the solution makes sense

## üìã Problem-Solving Checklist

- [ ] **Identify the pattern** - Which problem type?
- [ ] **Check constraints** - Domain, range, special cases
- [ ] **Apply template** - Use standard approach
- [ ] **Simplify** - Look for shortcuts and identities
- [ ] **Verify** - Check answer makes sense
- [ ] **Consider alternatives** - Is there a simpler approach?

## üéØ AMC Success Tips

1. **Practice pattern recognition** - The more problems you see, the faster you'll recognize types
2. **Master the templates** - Know the standard approaches by heart
3. **Watch for traps** - Common pitfalls in each problem type
4. **Time management** - Some patterns are faster to solve than others
5. **Check your work** - AMC problems often have elegant solutions
