# ðŸ”¢ Number Theory Practice Construction Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Construction Rules

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy (E)**: AMC10 Q1-10 level, basic divisibility, simple modular arithmetic
- **Medium (M)**: AMC10 Q11-20 / AMC12 Q1-15 level, requires GCD/LCM or basic Diophantine equations
- **Hard (H)**: AMC10 Q21-25 / AMC12 Q16-25 level, sophisticated techniques like Chinese Remainder Theorem

### Topic Coverage Matrix

| Topic | Mixed Sets | Topic Drills | Mock Exams |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Divisibility & GCD/LCM | 25% | 100% (divisibility) | 24% |
| Modular Arithmetic | 20% | 100% (modular) | 20% |
| Remainders & Last Digits | 15% | 100% (remainders) | 16% |
| Linear Diophantine | 15% | 100% (diophantine) | 16% |
| Digits & Bases | 15% | 100% (digits) | 16% |
| Chinese Remainder Theorem | 10% | 100% (crt) | 8% |

### Choice Distribution
- Aim for roughly equal distribution of correct answers (A, B, C, D, E)
- Avoid long runs of the same letter
- Include plausible distractors based on common number theory errors

### Solution Guidelines
- Keep solutions concise (one screen maximum)
- Highlight the key number theory technique (modular arithmetic, CRT, etc.)
- Include brief pitfall warnings when relevant
- Show alternative methods if significantly different

## ðŸŽ¯ Source Attribution

- **Original AMC**: `source: AMC10 YYYY #NN` or `source: AMC12 YYYY #NN`
- **AMC-style**: `source: Original (AMC-style)`
- **AMC12-leaning**: `source: Original (AMC12-leaning)`

## ðŸ“Š Set Construction

### Mixed Sets (25 questions)
- Q1-10: Easy level, basic number theory skills
- Q11-20: Medium level, multi-step modular reasoning
- Q21-25: Hard level, advanced techniques

### Topic Drills (12 questions)
- 4 Easy â†’ 5 Medium â†’ 3 Hard
- Focus on specific sub-patterns within each topic
- Cover all major problem types for that topic

### Mock Exams
- Full 25-question format
- Realistic difficulty distribution
- Time pressure simulation (75 minutes)
