# Chicken McNugget Theorem

If you can only purchase McNuggets in packs of size $a$ and $b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1), the largest number of McNuggets that you **cannot** purchase is given by:

$$

\text{Largest Unreachable Number} = ab - a - b

$$

This is known as the **Frobenius number** for two numbers, where: $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.
