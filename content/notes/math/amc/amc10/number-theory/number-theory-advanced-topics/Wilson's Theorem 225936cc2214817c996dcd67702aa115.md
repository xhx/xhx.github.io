# Wilson's Theorem

**Wilson's Theorem** is a result in number theory that characterizes prime numbers using factorials and modular arithmetic. It provides a criterion to test whether a number is prime.

### Statement:

A positive integer \( p \) is prime if and only if:

$$

(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}

$$

This means that if \( p \) is a prime number, the factorial of \( (p - 1) \) is congruent to \( -1 \) modulo \( p \). Equivalently, you can write:

$$

(p - 1)! \equiv (p - 1) \pmod{p}

$$

### Example:

Let’s verify Wilson’s theorem for a few small primes.

### Example 1: \( p = 5 \)

We need to check whether \( 4! \equiv -1 \pmod{5} \).
\[
4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
\]
Now, calculate \( 24 \mod 5 \):
\[
24 \div 5 = 4 \text{ remainder } 4
\]
So, \( 24 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), and since \( -1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), Wilson’s theorem holds.

### Example 2: \( p = 7 \)

We need to check whether \( 6! \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \).
\[
6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
\]
Now, calculate \( 720 \mod 7 \):
\[
720 \div 7 = 102 \text{ remainder } 6
\]
So, \( 720 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), and since \( -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), Wilson’s theorem holds.

### Application to Composite Numbers:

If \( p \) is composite, then Wilson's theorem does **not** hold. For a composite number \( n \), \( (n - 1)! \not\equiv -1 \pmod{n} \).

### Example for a Composite Number: \( n = 6 \)

Let’s check if \( 5! \equiv -1 \pmod{6} \):
\[
5! = 120
\]
Now, calculate \( 120 \mod 6 \):
\[
120 \div 6 = 20 \text{ remainder } 0
\]
So, \( 120 \equiv 0 \pmod{6} \), which is not congruent to \( -1 \), proving that Wilson’s theorem does not hold for composite numbers.

### Applications:

1. **Prime testing**: While Wilson’s theorem provides a way to test for primes, it is not practical for large numbers because computing factorials grows very fast.
2. **Number theory**: The theorem is important for theoretical purposes and is often used in the study of modular arithmetic and properties of prime numbers.

### Summary:

Wilson’s Theorem gives a neat, albeit impractical, test for primes. It says that for a prime \( p \), the factorial of \( (p-1) \) leaves a remainder of \( -1 \) when divided by \( p \). If \( p \) is composite, this relation does not hold.
