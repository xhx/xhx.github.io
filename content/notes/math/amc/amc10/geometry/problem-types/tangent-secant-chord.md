# ‚≠ï Tangent-Secant-Chord

Circle power problems are common in AMC geometry. Master these patterns for efficient circle problem solving.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Tangents** - Look for lines touching circles at exactly one point
- **Secants** - Look for lines intersecting circles at two points
- **Chords** - Look for line segments connecting two points on circles
- **Power of a Point** - Look for products of lengths from external points

### Common Setups
- External point with tangents and secants
- Intersecting chords or secants
- Tangent-secant configurations
- Equal tangent lengths

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify the Configuration
- Determine if you have tangents, secants, or chords
- Identify the external point (if any)
- Mark given lengths and relationships

### Step 2: Apply Power of a Point
- **Tangent-Secant:** $PA^2 = PB \cdot PC$
- **Two Secants:** $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$
- **Two Chords:** $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
- Write the Power of a Point equation
- Substitute known values
- Solve for the unknown

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that the answer makes geometric sense
- Ensure all lengths are positive
- Verify the Power of a Point relationship

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** In the figure, $PA$ is tangent to the circle at $A$, $PB$ is a secant intersecting the circle at $B$ and $C$, and $PA = 6$, $PB = 4$. Find $BC$.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify configuration
- $PA$ is tangent to circle at $A$
- $PB$ is secant intersecting circle at $B$ and $C$
- $PA = 6$, $PB = 4$

**Step 2:** Apply Power of a Point
- This is a tangent-secant configuration
- Use formula: $PA^2 = PB \cdot PC$

**Step 3:** Set up equation
- $PA^2 = PB \cdot PC$
- $6^2 = 4 \cdot PC$
- $36 = 4 \cdot PC$
- $PC = 9$

**Step 4:** Find $BC$
- Since $PC = PB + BC$ and $PB = 4$
- $9 = 4 + BC$
- $BC = 5$

**Answer:** $BC = 5$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Wrong Power of a Point formula
- **Fix:** Remember that tangent-secant uses $PA^2 = PB \cdot PC$

**Pitfall:** Confusing tangent and secant
- **Fix:** Tangent touches circle at one point, secant intersects at two points

**Pitfall:** Wrong segment identification
- **Fix:** Make sure you're using the correct segments in the formula

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about equal tangents
- **Fix:** From external point, two tangents are always equal in length

## üí° Quick Reference

### Power of a Point Formulas
- **Tangent-Secant:** $PA^2 = PB \cdot PC$
- **Two Secants:** $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$
- **Two Chords:** $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$

### Common Properties
- **Equal Tangents:** From external point, two tangents are equal
- **Chord Length:** $2\sqrt{r^2 - d^2}$ where $r$ is radius, $d$ is distance from center
- **Tangent Properties:** Tangent is perpendicular to radius at point of contact

### Solution Strategy
- **Identify:** Determine tangent, secant, or chord configuration
- **Apply:** Use appropriate Power of a Point formula
- **Calculate:** Solve for unknown lengths
- **Verify:** Check that answer makes geometric sense
