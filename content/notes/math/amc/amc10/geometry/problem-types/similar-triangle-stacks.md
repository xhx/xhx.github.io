# üî∫ Similar Triangle Stacks

Similar triangles often appear in "stacked" configurations with parallel lines or homothety. Master these patterns for efficient problem solving.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Parallel lines** - Look for multiple parallel lines creating similar triangles
- **Homothety** - Look for scaling transformations or similar figures
- **Ladder problems** - Look for figures that look like ladders or steps
- **Gap problems** - Look for missing segments between similar triangles

### Common Setups
- Trapezoids with parallel bases
- Triangles with parallel sides
- Figures with multiple similar triangles
- Scaling transformations

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify Similarity
- Look for parallel lines or equal angles
- Check if triangles are similar by AA, SAS, or SSS
- Mark the similarity relationship

### Step 2: Find the Ratio
- Identify corresponding sides
- Calculate the similarity ratio
- Use the ratio to find unknown lengths

### Step 3: Apply the Ratio
- Use the similarity ratio to find missing lengths
- Apply to all corresponding sides
- Check that ratios are consistent

### Step 4: Verify
- Ensure all triangles are actually similar
- Check that ratios are consistent
- Verify the final answer

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** In trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB \parallel CD$, $AB = 8$, $CD = 4$, and $AD = 6$. If $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$ and $F$ is the midpoint of $BC$, find $EF$.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify similarity
- $AB \parallel CD$ creates similar triangles
- $\triangle AEB \sim \triangle CED$ by AA (corresponding angles equal)

**Step 2:** Find the ratio
- Similarity ratio: $\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$
- This means $AE:CE = 2:1$

**Step 3:** Apply the ratio
- Since $E$ is midpoint of $AD$, $AE = 3$
- From similarity: $CE = \frac{AE}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$
- Therefore, $AC = AE + CE = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5$

**Step 4:** Find $EF$
- $EF$ is the midsegment of trapezoid $ABCD$
- Midsegment length = $\frac{AB + CD}{2} = \frac{8 + 4}{2} = 6$

**Answer:** $EF = 6$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Assuming similarity without proof
- **Fix:** Use AA, SAS, or SSS criteria to establish similarity

**Pitfall:** Wrong similarity ratio
- **Fix:** Make sure you're using corresponding sides in the same order

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about midsegments
- **Fix:** In trapezoids, midsegments have special length formulas

**Pitfall:** Wrong order in similarity statements
- **Fix:** Always match corresponding vertices: $A \leftrightarrow D$, $B \leftrightarrow E$, $C \leftrightarrow F$

## üí° Quick Reference

### Similarity Criteria
- **AA:** Two angles equal (third automatically equal)
- **SAS:** Two sides proportional + included angle equal
- **SSS:** All three sides proportional

### Common Ratios
- **Parallel lines:** Create similar triangles with constant ratio
- **Homothety:** Scale factor determines similarity ratio
- **Midsegments:** Special length formulas in trapezoids

### Solution Strategy
- **Identify:** Look for parallel lines or equal angles
- **Prove:** Use similarity criteria
- **Calculate:** Find similarity ratio
- **Apply:** Use ratio to find unknown lengths
