# 🔄 Angle Chase Cycles

Angle chasing is one of the most common problem types in AMC geometry. Master these patterns for systematic angle finding.

## 🎯 Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Parallel lines** - Look for $\parallel$ symbols or equal corresponding angles
- **Circles** - Look for inscribed angles, central angles, or cyclic quadrilaterals
- **Triangles** - Look for angle sums, exterior angles, or special triangles
- **Vertical angles** - Look for intersecting lines creating equal opposite angles

### Common Setups
- Lines intersecting with parallel lines
- Points on circles with chords or tangents
- Triangles with angle bisectors or altitudes
- Quadrilaterals with parallel sides

## 🧩 Solution Template

### Step 1: Mark Given Angles
- Circle or highlight all given angle measures
- Mark equal angles with the same symbol
- Mark right angles with small squares

### Step 2: Identify the Pattern
- **Parallel lines:** Use corresponding, alternate interior, or same-side interior angles
- **Circles:** Use inscribed angle theorem or opposite angles in cyclic quadrilaterals
- **Triangles:** Use angle sum theorem or exterior angle theorem
- **Vertical angles:** Use equal opposite angles

### Step 3: Follow the Chain
- Start with given angles
- Apply the appropriate theorem
- Use the result to find the next angle
- Continue until you reach the target angle

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that all angles make geometric sense
- Ensure angle sums are correct
- Verify the final answer

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Problem:** In the figure, $AB \parallel CD$, $\angle BAE = 40°$, and $\angle DCE = 60°$. Find $\angle AEC$.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Mark given angles
- $\angle BAE = 40°$
- $\angle DCE = 60°$
- $AB \parallel CD$

**Step 2:** Identify pattern
- Parallel lines with transversal
- Need to find angle at intersection

**Step 3:** Follow the chain
- Since $AB \parallel CD$, we can use parallel line properties
- Draw auxiliary line $EF \parallel AB \parallel CD$ through point $E$
- $\angle BAE = \angle AEF = 40°$ (alternate interior angles)
- $\angle DCE = \angle CEF = 60°$ (alternate interior angles)
- $\angle AEC = \angle AEF + \angle CEF = 40° + 60° = 100°$

**Step 4:** Verify
- $40° + 60° = 100°$ ✓
- Angle makes geometric sense ✓

**Answer:** $\angle AEC = 100°$

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Assuming parallel lines without proof
- **Fix:** Look for given information or use angle relationships to prove parallelism

**Pitfall:** Wrong angle relationships
- **Fix:** Remember that corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about supplementary angles
- **Fix:** Linear pairs sum to $180°$, same-side interior angles sum to $180°$

**Pitfall:** Wrong inscribed angle theorem
- **Fix:** Inscribed angle is half the arc measure, not equal to it

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Angle Relationships
- **Parallel lines:** Corresponding equal, alternate interior equal, same-side interior supplementary
- **Circles:** Inscribed angle half arc, opposite angles in cyclic quad supplementary
- **Triangles:** Angle sum $180°$, exterior angle equals sum of non-adjacent interior angles
- **Vertical angles:** Equal opposite angles

### Common Triggers
- **$\parallel$ symbol:** Look for parallel line properties
- **Circle:** Look for inscribed angle theorem
- **Triangle:** Look for angle sum or exterior angle theorem
- **Intersecting lines:** Look for vertical angles
