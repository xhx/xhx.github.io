# üéØ Extremal Geometry Paths

Extremal geometry problems involve finding maximum or minimum values of geometric quantities. Master these techniques for AMC success.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Minimum distance** - Look for shortest path problems
- **Maximum area** - Look for largest area problems
- **Reflection method** - Look for problems involving reflections
- **Optimization** - Look for problems asking for extreme values

### Common Setups
- Shortest path between points
- Largest area with given constraints
- Minimum perimeter problems
- Reflection across lines

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify the Extremal Problem
- Determine if you need maximum or minimum
- Identify the constraint
- Look for reflection opportunities

### Step 2: Apply Reflection Method
- Reflect one point across the constraint line
- Draw line from other point to reflected point
- Find intersection with constraint line

### Step 3: Calculate the Extremal Value
- Use the reflection method result
- Apply distance or area formulas
- Solve for the extremal value

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that the solution satisfies constraints
- Ensure the extremal value is correct
- Verify the final answer

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** Point $A$ is at $(0,0)$ and point $B$ is at $(4,2)$. Find the shortest path from $A$ to $B$ that touches the line $y = 1$.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify extremal problem
- Need shortest path from $A$ to $B$ touching line $y = 1$
- This is a minimum distance problem

**Step 2:** Apply reflection method
- Reflect point $A$ across line $y = 1$
- Reflected point $A'$ is at $(0,2)$
- Draw line from $A'$ to $B$

**Step 3:** Calculate extremal value
- Line from $A'(0,2)$ to $B(4,2)$ has equation $y = 2$
- Intersection with $y = 1$ is at $(2,1)$
- Shortest path: $A$ to $(2,1)$ to $B$

**Step 4:** Find distance
- Distance from $A$ to $(2,1)$: $\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{5}$
- Distance from $(2,1)$ to $B$: $\sqrt{(4-2)^2 + (2-1)^2} = \sqrt{5}$
- Total distance: $2\sqrt{5}$

**Answer:** $2\sqrt{5}$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
