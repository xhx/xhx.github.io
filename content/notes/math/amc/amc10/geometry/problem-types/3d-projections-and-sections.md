# üì¶ 3D Projections & Sections

3D geometry problems often involve projections and cross-sections. Master these techniques for AMC 12 success.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **3D figures** - Look for cubes, prisms, pyramids, or spheres
- **Projections** - Look for problems involving projecting 3D figures onto 2D planes
- **Cross-sections** - Look for problems involving slicing 3D figures
- **Areas/lengths** - Look for problems asking for areas or lengths in 3D

### Common Setups
- Cubes with cross-sections
- Prisms with projections
- Pyramids with sections
- Spheres with projections

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify the 3D Figure
- Determine the type of 3D figure
- Identify key dimensions and properties
- Mark given information

### Step 2: Find the Projection or Section
- Determine what 2D figure results from projection or section
- Calculate dimensions of the 2D figure
- Use 2D geometry to find areas or lengths

### Step 3: Apply 3D Properties
- Use 3D formulas for volumes or surface areas
- Apply projection formulas
- Use similar triangles or other 2D techniques

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that the 2D figure makes sense
- Ensure all calculations are correct
- Verify the final answer

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** A cube with side length 6 is cut by a plane that passes through the midpoints of three edges meeting at a vertex. Find the area of the cross-section.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify 3D figure
- Cube with side length 6
- Plane passes through midpoints of three edges

**Step 2:** Find the cross-section
- The cross-section is a triangle
- Vertices are at midpoints of three edges
- Each edge of the triangle is the diagonal of a face

**Step 3:** Calculate dimensions
- Each edge of the triangle is $\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = 6\sqrt{2}$
- This is an equilateral triangle with side length $6\sqrt{2}$
- Area = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (6\sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 72 = 18\sqrt{3}$

**Step 4:** Verify
- Check that cross-section is triangle ‚úì
- Calculate area correctly ‚úì
- Answer makes sense ‚úì

**Answer:** $18\sqrt{3}$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Wrong cross-section identification
- **Fix:** Carefully determine what 2D figure results from the cut

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about 3D properties
- **Fix:** Use 3D formulas when appropriate

**Pitfall:** Wrong projection setup
- **Fix:** Make sure you understand the projection direction

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about similar triangles
- **Fix:** Look for similar triangles in 3D problems

- **Pyramid:** Base connected to apex
- **Sphere:** All points equidistant from center

### Solution Strategy
- **Identify:** Look for 3D figures with projections or sections
- **Project:** Find the 2D projection or section
- **Calculate:** Use 2D geometry to find areas or lengths
- **Verify:** Check that answer makes geometric sense
