# üìê Area Ratio in Triangle

Area ratios in triangles are powerful tools for finding relationships between different parts of a triangle. Master these patterns for efficient problem solving.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Medians** - Look for lines from vertices to midpoints of opposite sides
- **Cevians** - Look for lines from vertices to opposite sides
- **Shared heights** - Look for triangles with the same height
- **Shared bases** - Look for triangles with the same base

### Common Setups
- Triangles with medians or cevians
- Figures with shared heights or bases
- Area comparisons
- Ratio problems

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify the Configuration
- Determine if you have medians, cevians, or shared heights/bases
- Mark given lengths and relationships
- Identify what ratios you need to find

### Step 2: Apply Area Ratio Principles
- **Shared height:** Area ratio = base ratio
- **Shared base:** Area ratio = height ratio
- **Medians:** Divide triangle into six equal areas
- **Cevians:** Use area ratios based on side splits

### Step 3: Set Up the Ratio
- Write the area ratio equation
- Substitute known values
- Solve for the unknown

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that the ratio makes geometric sense
- Ensure all areas are positive
- Verify the final answer

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** In triangle $ABC$, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $E$ is the midpoint of $AC$. If the area of triangle $ABC$ is 24, find the area of triangle $ADE$.

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify configuration
- $D$ is midpoint of $BC$ (median)
- $E$ is midpoint of $AC$ (median)
- Area of $ABC = 24$

**Step 2:** Apply area ratio principles
- Medians divide triangle into six equal areas
- Each small triangle has area $\frac{24}{6} = 4$
- Triangle $ADE$ is one of these small triangles

**Step 3:** Calculate area
- Area of $ADE = 4$

**Step 4:** Verify
- Check that medians create six equal areas ‚úì
- Area is positive ‚úì
- Answer makes sense ‚úì

**Answer:** Area of $ADE = 4$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Wrong area ratio formula
- **Fix:** Remember that shared height means area ratio = base ratio

**Pitfall:** Confusing medians and cevians
- **Fix:** Medians go to midpoints, cevians go to any point on opposite side

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about shared heights
- **Fix:** Look for triangles with the same height

**Pitfall:** Wrong median area division
- **Fix:** Medians divide triangle into six equal areas
