# üé≤ Geometric Probability Patterns

Geometric probability problems combine geometry with probability. Master these patterns for efficient problem solving.

## üéØ Recognition Cues

### Key Triggers
- **Random points** - Look for problems involving random points
- **Random chords** - Look for problems involving random chords
- **Random regions** - Look for problems involving random areas
- **Probability** - Look for problems asking for probabilities

### Common Setups
- Random points on line segments
- Random chords in circles
- Random points in regions
- Random lines through figures

## üß© Solution Template

### Step 1: Identify the Geometric Setup
- Determine the geometric figure involved
- Identify the total geometric measure
- Identify the favorable geometric measure

### Step 2: Calculate Geometric Measures
- **Length probability:** Use length ratios
- **Area probability:** Use area ratios
- **Volume probability:** Use volume ratios

### Step 3: Apply Probability Formula
- Use the formula: $P = \frac{\text{Favorable measure}}{\text{Total measure}}$
- Substitute calculated values
- Simplify the fraction

### Step 4: Verify
- Check that probability is between 0 and 1
- Ensure all measures are positive
- Verify the final answer

## üîç Worked Example

**Problem:** A point is chosen randomly inside a square with side length 6. What is the probability that the point is within 2 units of the center?

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Identify geometric setup
- Square with side length 6
- Total area = $6^2 = 36$
- Favorable area = circle of radius 2 centered at square center

**Step 2:** Calculate geometric measures
- Total area = 36
- Favorable area = $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$

**Step 3:** Apply probability formula
- $P = \frac{4\pi}{36} = \frac{\pi}{9}$

**Step 4:** Verify
- Check that circle fits in square ‚úì
- Probability is between 0 and 1 ‚úì
- Answer makes sense ‚úì

**Answer:** $\frac{\pi}{9}$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Wrong geometric measure
- **Fix:** Use length for 1D, area for 2D, volume for 3D

**Pitfall:** Forgetting to check if point is in region
- **Fix:** Make sure random point satisfies given conditions

**Pitfall:** Wrong probability formula
- **Fix:** Always use $\frac{\text{Favorable}}{\text{Total}}$

**Pitfall:** Forgetting units
- **Fix:** Make sure units match (length with length, area with area)
