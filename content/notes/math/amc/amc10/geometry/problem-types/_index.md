# 🧩 Problem Types

Master the art of pattern recognition in AMC geometry. This catalog helps you identify common problem setups and apply the right solution strategies.

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Setup
- Look for key geometric configurations
- Identify given information and what's being asked
- Check for special properties or relationships

### Step 2: Apply the Template
- Use the appropriate solution template
- Follow the standard approach for that problem type
- Adapt the template to the specific problem

### Step 3: Verify and Check
- Ensure your solution makes geometric sense
- Check for common pitfalls
- Verify units and final answer

## 📚 Problem Type Catalog

### 🔺 Triangle Patterns
- [**Angle Chase Cycles**](angle-chase-cycles) - Inscribed angles, parallel lines, cyclic triggers
- [**Similar Triangle Stacks**](similar-triangle-stacks) - Parallel lines, homothety, "gaps"/ladder problems
- [**Area Ratio in Triangle**](area-ratio-in-triangle) - Medians/cevian splits, barycentric-like ratios

### ⭕ Circle Patterns
- [**Tangent-Secant-Chord**](tangent-secant-chord) - Equal tangents, PoP, intersecting chords/secants
- [**Cyclic Quad Setups**](cyclic-quad-setups) - Equal subtended angles, Ptolemy applications
- [**Circle Packing Touching**](circle-packing-touching) - Chains of tangencies, equal radii relations

### 📐 Coordinate Patterns
- [**Coordinate Kill**](coordinate-kill) - Translate/rotate/scale, shoelace, determinant tricks
- [**Extremal Geometry Paths**](extremal-geometry-paths) - Reflection method, minimum distance/path

### 🔄 Advanced Patterns
- [**Mass Points Templates**](mass-points-templates) - Standard lever setups, weighted Ceva
- [**3D Projections & Sections**](3d-projections-and-sections) - Areas/lengths via projection, prism/cube cross-sections
- [**Geometric Probability Patterns**](geometric-probability-patterns) - Random chords/points on segments/regions

## 🎯 How to Use This Catalog

### For Practice
1. **Study each pattern** - Understand the recognition cues
2. **Practice templates** - Work through the solution steps
3. **Build recognition** - Learn to spot patterns quickly

### For Contests
1. **Quick scan** - Look for familiar patterns
2. **Apply template** - Use the standard approach
3. **Adapt as needed** - Modify for specific problem details

### For Review
1. **Identify gaps** - Which patterns need more practice
2. **Focus study** - Work on weak pattern recognition
3. **Build speed** - Practice quick pattern identification

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Mark equalities** on diagrams immediately
- **Look for parallel lines** - they create similar triangles
- **Check for cyclicity** - equal subtended angles often appear
- **Use coordinate geometry** when pure geometry gets messy
- **Estimate first** - eliminate obviously wrong answers
