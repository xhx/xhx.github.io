# #7 – Cyclic-Quadrilateral Angle Chases

The picture shows a quadrilateral ABCDABCD with all four vertices on one circle.

Draw in the diagonals ACAC and BDBD and two facts do 90 % of the AMC work:

| Fact | How to use it |
| --- | --- |
| **Opposite angles supplement** | ∠A+∠C=∠B+∠D=180∘\angle A + \angle C = \angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ.  Spot a single angle → its opposite is “180 – that.” |
| **Inscribed-angle equality** | Angles that subtend the *same arc* are equal (e.g. ∠BAD=∠BCD\angle BAD = \angle BCD, both cut arc BDBD).  Lets you port a known angle across the quad. |

### 1 Rapid-Fire Examples

| Given | Find | One-liner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ∠A=70∘,∠B=85∘\angle A = 70^\circ, \angle B = 85^\circ | ∠C\angle C | C=180−70=110∘.C = 180 - 70 = 110^\circ. |
| AB=CDAB=CD (equal chords) | Show ∠ACB=∠CAD\angle ACB = \angle CAD | Equal chords ⇒ equal arcs ⇒ equal inscribed angles. |
| ∠BAD=30∘,∠CBD=34∘\angle BAD = 30^\circ, \angle CBD = 34^\circ | ∠BCD\angle BCD | Use equal-arc idea twice; often collapses because two equal angles sum to the supplementary opposite. |

### 2 Ptolemy Sneak Peek

Once lengths show up, **Ptolemy’s Theorem** kicks in: AC⋅BD=AB⋅CD+BC⋅DAAC\cdot BD = AB\cdot CD + BC\cdot DA.

That ties the six edges of the plot together in a single line of algebra—another AMC favorite.

### 3 Speed Checklist

1. **“Cyclic” or picture of all four points on one circle?** Write “opp. ∠ sum 180” before anything else.
2. Extra **equal-side** info? Translate to equal arcs → equal angles.
3. **Ask for a diagonal?** Probably Ptolemy (length) or equal-angle chase (angle).

Nail those two theorems and the majority of AMC 10 cyclic-quad problems fall in under a minute.
