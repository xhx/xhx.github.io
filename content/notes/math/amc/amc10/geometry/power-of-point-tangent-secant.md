# #6 – Power of a Point (PoP): Tangent–Secant & Chord–Chord

*(See the diagram: navy chords AB,CDAB, CD intersect at PP.
A tangent at TT and a secant S ⁣E ⁣FS\!E\!F illustrate the other two PoP forms.)*

## 1 Master Formulas

| Configuration | Statement | Mnemonic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chord–Chord** (inside) | PA⋅PB  =  PC⋅PDPA \cdot PB \;=\; PC \cdot PD | “Product of the two chunks” |
| **Secant–Secant** (outside) | SA⋅SB  =  SC⋅SDSA\cdot SB \;=\; SC\cdot SD | whole × outer = whole × outer |
| **Tangent–Secant** (outside) | ST2  =  SE⋅SFST^{2} \;=\; SE\cdot SF | tangent² = outer × whole |

*(Labels match the graphic: PP inside, SS outside, tangent point TT.)*

All three are corollaries of similar triangles formed by equal inscribed angles.

## 2 Canonical AMC Prompts & One-Line Solutions

| Wording cue | Plug-in step |
| --- | --- |
| “Two chords intersect at PP; find PDPD.  Given PA,PB,PCPA,PB,PC.” | Use PA⋅PB=PC⋅PDPA\cdot PB = PC\cdot PD. |
| “External point SS; tangent length 88, secant hits circle at E,FE,F.  Find SFSF.” | 82=SE⋅SF8^{2}=SE\cdot SF. |
| “Circle, equal power from two points → show points are equidistant from center.” | Set products equal; deduce equal distances. |
| “Right-triangle incircle length” | Combine ST2ST^{2} with r=a+b−c2r=\tfrac{a+b-c}{2}. |

## 3 Worked Example A – Chord–Chord

> In circle OO, chords ABAB and CDCD intersect at PP.
> 
> 
> If PA=3,  PB=5,  PC=2PA=3,\;PB=5,\;PC=2, find PDPD.
> 

PA⋅PB=PC⋅PD  ⟹  3⋅5=2⋅PD  ⟹  PD=7.5.PA\cdot PB = PC\cdot PD
\;\Longrightarrow\;
3\cdot5 = 2\cdot PD
\;\Longrightarrow\;
PD = 7.5.

*(AMC answer choice likely appears as 152 \tfrac{15}{2}.)*

## 4 Worked Example B – Tangent–Secant

> From a point QQ outside a circle the tangent length is 1010.
> 
> 
> A secant through QQ meets the circle at EE and FF with QE=4QE = 4.
> 
> Find QFQF.
> 

QT2=QE⋅QF⇒102=4⋅QF⇒QF=25.QT^{2}=QE\cdot QF \Rightarrow 10^{2}=4\cdot QF\Rightarrow QF=25.

## 5 Mix with Similarity for Angle Chasing

- **If chords are perpendicular?** Use PA2=PC⋅PDPA^{2} = PC \cdot PD (a special case with equal chunks).
- **Equal chord lengths** → equal products give equal powers: often forces two secants to be symmetric or collinear.

## 6 Recognition Checklist

| Diagram / text | Mental trigger |
| --- | --- |
| Two lines through the same external point touching the circle differently | Secant–secant or tangent–secant; write product rule immediately. |
| Chords crossing inside with three lengths given | PoP will spit out the fourth. |
| Problem asks for *square* of tangent segment | That screams “tangent² = secant product.” |
| Options include radicals? | Could be using Pythagorean triple through ST2ST^{2}. |

### Take-Away

Once you spot “power of a point,” plug the product—AMC problems almost always hand-pick numbers so the arithmetic finishes in under 30 seconds.
