# 🎯 Study Strategy

Effective strategies for mastering AMC 10 geometry and achieving competition success.

## 📚 Step-by-Step Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)
1. **📖 Start with the fundamentals** - Master basic triangle and circle properties
   - Review basic angle relationships
   - Understand triangle congruence and similarity
   - Learn circle theorems and properties

2. **🔢 Memorize essential formulas**
   - Special right triangle ratios
   - Area and perimeter formulas
   - Basic coordinate geometry formulas

### Phase 2: Problem Type Mastery (Weeks 3-6)
1. **🎯 Focus on problem types** - Practice the top 20 problem patterns
   - Start with Easy problems (types 1, 2, 8)
   - Progress to Medium difficulty (types 3-7, 9-12, 15-16, 20)
   - Challenge yourself with Hard problems (types 13-14, 17-19)

2. **📝 Work through detailed guides** - Use the comprehensive topic guides
   - Study one topic per day
   - Practice with related problems
   - Review and reinforce understanding

### Phase 3: Advanced Practice (Weeks 7-8)
1. **🔄 Practice regularly** - Solve problems from each category
   - Mix different problem types
   - Time yourself to simulate exam conditions
   - Focus on speed and accuracy

2. **📊 Track your progress** - Note which problem types need more practice
   - Keep a log of solved problems
   - Identify weak areas
   - Focus extra time on challenging topics

## ⏰ Daily Study Schedule

### Weekday Sessions (30-45 minutes)
- **Monday**: Triangle fundamentals and special triangles
- **Tuesday**: Circle properties and power of a point
- **Wednesday**: Coordinate geometry and 3D problems
- **Thursday**: Similarity and angle chasing
- **Friday**: Mixed practice and review

### Weekend Sessions (60-90 minutes)
- **Saturday**: Focus on one difficult topic
- **Sunday**: Full practice test or comprehensive review

## 🎯 Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. Read and Understand
- Read the problem carefully
- Identify what's given and what's asked
- Draw a clear diagram if needed

### 2. Choose Your Strategy
- Look for special triangles or Pythagorean triples
- Check for similarity or congruence
- Consider coordinate geometry if appropriate
- Apply relevant theorems or formulas

### 3. Execute and Check
- Work through the solution step by step
- Check your answer against the given options
- Verify your reasoning makes sense

## 📈 Progress Tracking
