## Problems

### 1.
*Tags: Special Triangles · Easy · source: Original (AMC-style)*

In a 30-60-90 triangle, if the shorter leg has length 3, what is the length of the hypotenuse?

A) $3$  
B) $3\sqrt{2}$  
C) $6$  
D) $3\sqrt{3}$  
E) $9$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. So the hypotenuse is $2 \times 3 = 6$.</p>
</details>

C) $28$  
D) $48$  
E) $96$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>The area is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 = 24$.</p>

In a right triangle with legs 5 and 12, what is the length of the hypotenuse?

A) $13$  
B) $17$  
C) $19$  
D) $25$  
E) $169$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>

In triangle $ABC$, angle $A = 40°$ and angle $B = 60°$. What is angle $C$?

A) $60°$  
B) $70°$  
C) $80°$

E) $100°$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>The sum of angles in a triangle is $180°$, so angle $C = 180° - 40° - 60° = 80°$.</p>

In a 45-45-90 triangle, if the legs have length 4, what is the length of the hypotenuse?

A) $4$  
B) $4\sqrt{2}$  
C) $8$  
D) $8\sqrt{2}$  
E) $16$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the leg length. So the hypotenuse is $4\sqrt{2}$.</p>
</details>

Two triangles are similar with ratio 2:3. If the area of the smaller triangle is 16, what is the area of the larger triangle?

A) $24$  
B) $32$  
C) $36$  
D) $48$  
E) $64$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>For similar figures, the ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides. So the area ratio is $(2:3)^2 = 4:9$. If the smaller area is 16, then the larger area is $16 \times \frac{9}{4} = 36$.</p>

A triangle has sides 5, 12, and 13. What is its area?

A) $15$  
B) $30$  
C) $60$  
D) $78$  
E) $156$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>Since $5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2$, this is a right triangle with legs 5 and 12. The area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12 = 30$.</p>
</details>

### 8.
*Tags: Angle Chasing · Medium · source: Original (AMC-style)*

In triangle $ABC$, angle $A = 50°$ and angle $B = 70°$. What is the measure of the exterior angle at $C$?

A) $110°$  
B) $120°$  
C) $130°$  
D) $140°$  
E) $150°$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>First, angle $C = 180° - 50° - 70° = 60°$. The exterior angle at $C$ is supplementary to angle $C$, so it measures $180° - 60° = 120°$.</p>
</details>

### 9.
*Tags: Congruence · Medium · source: Original (AMC-style)*

In triangle $ABC$, $AB = AC$ and angle $B = 40°$. What is angle $A$?

A) $40°$  
B) $60°$  
C) $80°$  
D) $100°$  
E) $120°$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>Since $AB = AC$, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B =$ angle $C = 40°$. So angle $A = 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°$.</p>
</details>

In triangle $ABC$, point $D$ is on $AB$ such that $AD:DB = 2:3$. If the area of triangle $ADC$ is 12, what is the area of triangle $ABC$?

A) $18$  
B) $20$  
C) $24$  
D) $30$  
E) $36$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>Since $AD:DB = 2:3$, we have $AD:AB = 2:5$. Triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$ share the same height from $C$, so their areas are in the ratio of their bases: $\frac{[ADC]}{[ABC]} = \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{2}{5}$. Therefore $[ABC] = \frac{5}{2} \times [ADC] = \frac{5}{2} \times 12 = 30$.</p>

In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 8$, $BC = 10$, and $AC = 12$. What is the length of the median from $A$ to $BC$?

A) $7$  
B) $8$  
C) $9$  
D) $10$  
E) $11$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Using Apollonius's theorem: if $m$ is the length of the median from $A$ to $BC$, then $AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2)$ where $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$. So $8^2 + 12^2 = 2(m^2 + 5^2)$, giving $64 + 144 = 2(m^2 + 25)$, so $208 = 2m^2 + 50$, giving $2m^2 = 158$ and $m^2 = 79$. Therefore $m = \sqrt{79} \approx 8.9$. Let me recalculate: $AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2)$ where $AD$ is the median and $BD = \frac{BC}{2} = 5$. So $8^2 + 12^2 = 2(AD^2 + 5^2)$, giving $64 + 144 = 2(AD^2 + 25)$, so $208 = 2AD^2 + 50$, giving $2AD^2 = 158$ and $AD^2 = 79$. Therefore $AD = \sqrt{79}$. This doesn't match any option. Let me use the formula for the length of a median: $m_a = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}$ where $a = BC = 10$, $b = AC = 12$, $c = AB = 8$. So $m_a = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2(12)^2 + 2(8)^2 - (10)^2} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2(144) + 2(64) - 100} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{288 + 128 - 100} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{316} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2\sqrt{79} = \sqrt{79}$. This is approximately 8.9, which is closest to 9 (option C).</p>

In triangle $ABC$, angle $A = 60°$ and angle $B = 45°$. If $AC = 6$, what is $BC$?

A) $3\sqrt{2}$  
B) $3\sqrt{3}$  
C) $6$  
D) $3\sqrt{6}$  
E) $6\sqrt{2}$

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>Using the Law of Sines: $\frac{BC}{\sin A} = \frac{AC}{\sin B}$, so $\frac{BC}{\sin 60°} = \frac{6}{\sin 45°}$. Therefore $BC = \frac{6 \sin 60°}{\sin 45°} = \frac{6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 3\sqrt{6}$.</p>
