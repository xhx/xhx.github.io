# üìê Geometry Practice Construction Guide

## üìã Problem Construction Rules

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy (E)**: AMC10 Q1-10 level, basic angle chasing, simple area calculations
- **Medium (M)**: AMC10 Q11-20 / AMC12 Q1-15 level, requires similarity, power of a point, or coordinate geometry
- **Hard (H)**: AMC10 Q21-25 / AMC12 Q16-25 level, sophisticated techniques like mass points or advanced coordinate geometry

### Topic Coverage Matrix

| Topic | Mixed Sets | Topic Drills | Mock Exams |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Triangles | 25% | 100% (triangles) | 24% |
| Circles & Power of Point | 20% | 100% (circles-pop) | 20% |
| Similarity & Ratios | 15% | 100% (similarity) | 16% |
| Coordinate Geometry | 15% | 100% (coordinate) | 16% |
| Area & Length Classics | 15% | 100% (area-length) | 16% |
| Cyclic Quadrilaterals | 10% | 100% (cyclic) | 8% |

### Choice Distribution
- Aim for roughly equal distribution of correct answers (A, B, C, D, E)
- Avoid long runs of the same letter
- Include plausible distractors based on common geometric errors

### Solution Guidelines
- Keep solutions concise (one screen maximum)
- Highlight the key geometric technique (power of point, similarity, etc.)
- Include brief pitfall warnings when relevant
- Show alternative geometric methods if significantly different

## üéØ Source Attribution

- **Original AMC**: `source: AMC10 YYYY #NN` or `source: AMC12 YYYY #NN`
- **AMC-style**: `source: Original (AMC-style)`
- **AMC12-leaning**: `source: Original (AMC12-leaning)`

## üìä Set Construction

### Mixed Sets (25 questions)
- Q1-10: Easy level, basic geometry skills
- Q11-20: Medium level, multi-step geometric reasoning
- Q21-25: Hard level, advanced techniques

### Topic Drills (12 questions)
- 4 Easy ‚Üí 5 Medium ‚Üí 3 Hard
- Focus on specific sub-patterns within each topic
- Cover all major problem types for that topic

### Mock Exams
- Full 25-question format
- Realistic difficulty distribution
- Time pressure simulation (75 minutes)
