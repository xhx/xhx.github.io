# üìñ Reference Materials

Essential reference materials for AMC geometry success. Keep these handy during practice and contests!

## üó∫Ô∏è Quick Navigation

- [**Scope Map**](scope-map) - AMC 10 vs AMC 12 topic coverage matrix
- [**Notation Cheatsheet**](notation-cheatsheet) - Symbols, conventions, and usage cues
- [**Concept Atlas**](concept-atlas) - One-paragraph primers for each topic area

## üéØ How to Use These References

### Before Practice
- Check the **Scope Map** to focus on appropriate topics for your level
- Review the **Notation Cheatsheet** to ensure consistent symbol usage
- Scan the **Concept Atlas** for quick topic refreshers

### During Contests
- Use **Notation Cheatsheet** for proper symbol conventions
- Reference **Scope Map** to gauge problem difficulty
- Quick-check **Concept Atlas** for topic connections

### After Practice
- Cross-reference with **Concept Atlas** to identify knowledge gaps
- Use **Scope Map** to track your progress across difficulty levels

## üìö Study Strategy

1. **Master the notation** - Consistent symbols prevent errors
2. **Know the scope** - Focus on appropriate difficulty levels
3. **Connect concepts** - Use the atlas to see how topics relate
4. **Practice recognition** - Use these references to build pattern recognition
