# üß† Problem-Solving Tips

Master these essential strategies for AMC geometry success. These tips will help you solve problems faster and more accurately.

## üîç Recognition Strategies

### Pattern Recognition
**When stuck:** Look for these common patterns:
- **Parallel lines** ‚Üí Similar triangles
- **Circles** ‚Üí Inscribed angles, Power of a Point
- **Equal angles** ‚Üí Parallel lines or cyclic quadrilaterals
- **Ratios** ‚Üí Similarity or area ratios
- **Coordinates** ‚Üí Distance, midpoint, shoelace formulas

### Quick Scans
**First 30 seconds:**
1. **Read the problem** - What's being asked?
2. **Identify the figure** - What type of geometric figure?
3. **Look for special properties** - Right angles, parallel lines, circles
4. **Check for given information** - What do you know?

### Key Triggers
**Look for these words/phrases:**
- "Parallel" ‚Üí Use parallel line properties
- "Tangent" ‚Üí Use Power of a Point or tangent properties
- "Similar" ‚Üí Use similarity ratios
- "Area" ‚Üí Use area formulas or ratios
- "Distance" ‚Üí Use distance formula or Pythagorean theorem

## üß© Solution Strategies

### Systematic Approach
**Step 1: Understand the problem**
- What's given?
- What's being asked?
- What type of problem is this?

**Step 2: Choose your method**
- Pure geometry
- Coordinate geometry
- Similarity
- Power of a Point
- Other specialized techniques

**Step 3: Execute the solution**
- Follow your chosen method
- Show all steps clearly
- Check your work as you go

**Step 4: Verify the answer**
- Does it make geometric sense?
- Are the units correct?
- Is the answer reasonable?

### Alternative Methods
**When your first approach fails:**
1. **Try coordinate geometry** - Often easier than pure geometry
2. **Look for similar triangles** - They appear frequently
3. **Use Power of a Point** - For circle problems
4. **Apply area ratios** - For ratio problems
5. **Try mass points** - For AMC 12 problems

### Verification Techniques
**Before submitting:**
- **Check units** - Make sure they match the problem
- **Verify calculations** - Redo key steps
- **Test special cases** - Does your answer work for simple cases?
- **Look for symmetry** - Does your answer respect symmetry?

## ‚è∞ Timing Strategies

### Time Allocation
**AMC 10/12 (75 minutes, 25 problems):**
- **Easy problems (1-10):** 1-2 minutes each
- **Medium problems (11-20):** 3-4 minutes each
- **Hard problems (21-25):** 5-7 minutes each
- **Total time:** 60-65 minutes
- **Buffer time:** 10-15 minutes for review

### Skip Strategies
**When to move on:**
- **After 2-3 minutes** on easy problems
- **After 4-5 minutes** on medium problems
- **After 6-7 minutes** on hard problems
- **When you're completely stuck** - Don't waste time

### Return Techniques
**How to come back:**
1. **Mark the problem** - Circle it or make a note
2. **Try a different approach** - Coordinate geometry, similarity, etc.
3. **Look for patterns** - What type of problem is this?
4. **Use elimination** - Cross out obviously wrong answers

## üéØ Accuracy Tips

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
**Calculation errors:**
- **Double-check arithmetic** - Especially with fractions and decimals
- **Watch signs** - Positive vs. negative
- **Check units** - Make sure they match

**Geometric errors:**
- **Wrong similarity setup** - Make sure corresponding vertices match
- **Incorrect Power of a Point** - Use the right formula for the configuration
- **Wrong angle relationships** - Check parallel lines and circle properties

**Formula errors:**
- **Wrong formula** - Make sure you're using the right one
- **Missing factors** - Don't forget $\frac{1}{2}$ or other factors
- **Wrong order** - Check formula order carefully

### Double-Checking Strategies
**Before submitting:**
1. **Reread the problem** - Make sure you understood it correctly
2. **Check your work** - Redo key calculations
3. **Verify units** - Make sure they match the problem
4. **Test your answer** - Does it make geometric sense?

## üîß Specific Techniques

### When Stuck
**Try these in order:**
1. **Look for parallel lines** - They create similar triangles
2. **Check for cyclicity** - Equal subtended angles often appear
3. **Use coordinate geometry** - When pure geometry gets messy
4. **Apply Power of a Point** - For circle problems
5. **Try similarity** - Look for similar triangles
6. **Use area ratios** - For ratio problems

### Similar Triangles Radar
**Look for these setups:**
- **Parallel lines** - Create similar triangles
- **Equal arcs** - Inscribed angles create similar triangles
- **Angle bisectors** - Often create similar triangles
- **Right triangles** - Look for shared acute angles

### Ratio Playbook
**Common ratio techniques:**
- **Angle bisector theorem** - $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC}$
- **Power of a Point** - $PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD$
- **Mass points** - For AMC 12 problems
- **Area ratios** - Via shared heights or bases

### Cyclic Triggers
**Look for these signs:**
- **Equal subtended angles** - Angles subtending same arc
- **Opposite angle sum $180¬∞$** - In cyclic quadrilaterals
- **Right angles with diameter** - Inscribed angle theorem

### Coordinate Kill
**When to use coordinates:**
- **Complex figures** - Hard to solve with pure geometry
- **Specific coordinates** - Given coordinate information
- **Area calculations** - Easier with shoelace formula
- **Distance problems** - Easier with distance formula

### Transformations
**When to use transformations:**
- **Reflection method** - For shortest path problems
- **Homothety** - For similar figures
- **Rotation** - For equal angles
- **Translation** - For parallel lines

### Diagram Discipline
**Keep your diagrams clean:**
- **Mark equalities** - Use the same symbol for equal lengths/angles
- **Label points** - Use consistent notation
- **Show given information** - Mark what you know
- **Keep it simple** - Don't overcrowd the diagram
