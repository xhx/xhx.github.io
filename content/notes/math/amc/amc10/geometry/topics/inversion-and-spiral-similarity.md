# üîÑ Inversion & Spiral Similarity

These advanced transformation techniques appear occasionally in AMC 12 problems. They can provide elegant solutions to complex geometric configurations.

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Inversion (Very Light)
**Definition:** Transformation that maps points to their inverses with respect to a circle
**Properties:**
- Maps circles to circles or lines
- Preserves angles
- Useful for tangent circle problems

**Basic Formula:** If $P$ inverts to $P'$ with respect to circle of radius $r$ centered at $O$:
$OP \cdot OP' = r^2$

### Spiral Similarity
**Definition:** Combination of rotation and homothety (scaling) about the same center
**Properties:**
- Preserves angles
- Scales distances by constant factor
- Useful for similar figures

**Key Insight:** Spiral similarity can map one figure to another similar figure

## üîç Micro-Examples

### Inversion Example
Point $P$ at distance 5 from center of circle of radius 3:
- Inversion distance: $OP' = \frac{3^2}{5} = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8$

### Spiral Similarity Example
Rotate triangle by $60¬∞$ and scale by factor 2:
- This is a spiral similarity
- All distances double, all angles preserved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Traps

**Pitfall:** Wrong inversion formula
- **Fix:** $OP \cdot OP' = r^2$, not $OP + OP' = r^2$

**Pitfall:** Confusing inversion and reflection
- **Fix:** Inversion uses circle, reflection uses line

**Pitfall:** Wrong spiral similarity setup
- **Fix:** Spiral similarity combines rotation and scaling

**Pitfall:** Forgetting about angle preservation
- **Fix:** Both inversion and spiral similarity preserve angles

## üéØ AMC-Style Worked Example

**Problem:** In the figure, two circles are tangent at point $A$. A line through $A$ intersects the circles at points $B$ and $C$. If the circles have radii 3 and 5, and $AB = 4$, find $AC$.

**Solution:**
This problem can be solved using inversion, but let's use a simpler approach.

Since the circles are tangent at $A$, the line through $A$ is tangent to both circles.

Using the Power of a Point theorem:
- For the first circle: $AB^2 = 4^2 = 16$
- For the second circle: $AC^2 = 16$ (same power)

Therefore, $AC = 4$.

**Answer:** $AC = 4$
