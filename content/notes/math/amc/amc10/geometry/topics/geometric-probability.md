# üé≤ Geometric Probability

Geometric probability problems combine geometry with probability, often involving random points, lines, or regions. The key is finding the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Basic Principle
**Fundamental:** Probability = $\frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$

In geometric probability:
- **Favorable outcomes** = favorable geometric measure (length, area, volume)
- **Total outcomes** = total geometric measure (length, area, volume)

### Common Problem Types
1. **Random points on line segments**
2. **Random chords in circles**
3. **Random points in regions**
4. **Random lines through figures**

### Probability Formulas
- **Length probability:** $P = \frac{\text{Favorable length}}{\text{Total length}}$
- **Area probability:** $P = \frac{\text{Favorable area}}{\text{Total area}}$
- **Volume probability:** $P = \frac{\text{Favorable volume}}{\text{Total volume}}$

## üîç Micro-Examples

### Random Point on Segment
Point chosen randomly on segment of length 10. Probability it's within 3 units of one end:
- Favorable length: 6 (3 from each end)
- Total length: 10
- Probability: $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$

### Random Chord in Circle
Chord chosen randomly in circle of radius 5. Probability it's longer than radius:
- Favorable: Chords longer than 5
- Total: All possible chords
- Need to calculate areas or use geometric properties

### Random Point in Region
Point chosen randomly in square of side 4. Probability it's within 1 unit of center:
- Favorable area: Circle of radius 1 = $\pi$
- Total area: Square = 16
- Probability: $\frac{\pi}{16}$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Traps

**Pitfall:** Wrong geometric measure
- **Fix:** Use length for 1D, area for 2D, volume for 3D

**Pitfall:** Forgetting to check if point is in region
- **Fix:** Make sure random point satisfies given conditions

**Pitfall:** Wrong probability formula
- **Fix:** Always use $\frac{\text{Favorable}}{\text{Total}}$

**Pitfall:** Forgetting units
- **Fix:** Make sure units match (length with length, area with area)

## üéØ AMC-Style Worked Example

**Problem:** A point is chosen randomly inside a square with side length 6. What is the probability that the point is within 2 units of the center?

**Solution:**
First, find the total area:
- Square area = $6^2 = 36$

Next, find the favorable area:
- Circle centered at square center with radius 2
- Circle area = $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$

Now, check if the circle fits entirely within the square:
- Circle diameter = $2 \cdot 2 = 4$
- Square side = 6
- Since $4 < 6$, the circle fits entirely within the square

Therefore, the probability is:
$P = \frac{4\pi}{36} = \frac{\pi}{9}$

**Answer:** $\frac{\pi}{9}$
