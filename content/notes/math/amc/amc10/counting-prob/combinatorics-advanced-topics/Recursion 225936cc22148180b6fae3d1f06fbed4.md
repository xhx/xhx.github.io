# Recursion

Recursion is a crucial topic on AMC and especially the AIME. For the elite programmers, they might find this topic similar to dynamic programming or many algorithms that they have seen.

Recursion reduces a harder problem into a smaller problem and relates it to larger numbers by setting up a relationship.

The Fibonacci sequence is a popular example of a recurrence relation in which the previous two terms are summed up to find your current term. In the Fibonacci Sequence, $F_n$ represents the nth term, and in this sequence $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. The recurrence relation is $F_n = F_{n −1} + F_{n − 2}$.
