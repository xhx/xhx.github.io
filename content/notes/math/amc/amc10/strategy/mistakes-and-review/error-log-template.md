# ðŸ“‹ Error Log Template

Use this systematic error tracking system to identify patterns, improve performance, and track progress over time. Consistent error logging is key to continuous improvement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Error Taxonomy

### Careless Errors
- **Calculation mistakes**: Arithmetic errors, sign errors, order of operations
- **Reading errors**: Misreading problems, missing key details, misinterpreting
- **Bubbling errors**: Wrong answer choice, incomplete bubbles, stray marks
- **Time pressure**: Rushing, skipping steps, not verifying

### Conceptual Errors
- **Misunderstanding**: Not understanding what the problem is asking
- **Wrong approach**: Using incorrect method or strategy
- **Missing knowledge**: Not knowing required concepts or formulas
- **Application errors**: Misapplying known concepts or formulas

### Strategic Errors
- **Time management**: Spending too much time on one problem
- **Guessing strategy**: Poor guessing decisions or not guessing when should
- **Problem selection**: Choosing wrong problems to solve or skip
- **Verification**: Not checking work properly or at all

## ðŸ“Š Error Log Template

### Basic Information
- **Date**: When the error occurred
- **Problem number**: Which problem (if from practice test)
- **Problem type**: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Counting/Probability, Precalculus
- **Difficulty level**: Easy (1-10), Medium (11-20), Hard (21-25)
- **Time spent**: How long you spent on the problem

### Error Details
- **Error category**: Careless, Conceptual, or Strategic
- **Specific error type**: Choose from taxonomy above
- **Description**: Detailed description of what went wrong
- **Correct approach**: What you should have done instead
- **Root cause**: Why did this error occur?

### Analysis
- **Pattern recognition**: Is this a recurring error type?
- **Prevention strategy**: How can you prevent this error in the future?
- **Practice needed**: What specific practice would help?
- **Confidence level**: How confident were you in your approach?

## ðŸŽ¯ Error Log Examples

### Example 1: Careless Error
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Problem**: #12 (Medium, Algebra)
**Error category**: Careless
**Specific error type**: Calculation mistake
**Description**: Made arithmetic error in solving $2x + 3 = 11$, wrote $2x = 14$ instead of $2x = 8$
**Correct approach**: Should have subtracted 3 from both sides: $2x = 8$, so $x = 4$
**Root cause**: Rushed through calculation without double-checking
**Pattern recognition**: This is the 3rd arithmetic error this week
**Prevention strategy**: Always double-check arithmetic, use plug-back verification
**Practice needed**: More mental math practice, slower calculation
**Confidence level**: High (knew the method, just made arithmetic error)

### Example 2: Conceptual Error
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Problem**: #18 (Hard, Geometry)
**Error category**: Conceptual
**Specific error type**: Wrong approach
**Description**: Tried to use coordinate geometry when similar triangles would have been easier
**Correct approach**: Should have recognized similar triangles and used proportional relationships
**Root cause**: Didn't recognize the similar triangle pattern
**Pattern recognition**: This is the 2nd time I've missed similar triangles this month
**Prevention strategy**: Always look for similar triangles first in geometry problems
**Practice needed**: More practice with similar triangle recognition
**Confidence level**: Medium (knew coordinate geometry but not the best approach)

### Example 3: Strategic Error
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Problem**: #22 (Hard, Number Theory)
**Error category**: Strategic
**Specific error type**: Time management
**Description**: Spent 8 minutes on this problem, should have moved on after 5 minutes
**Correct approach**: Should have tried modular arithmetic for 3 minutes, then moved on
**Root cause**: Got stuck and didn't want to give up
**Pattern recognition**: This is the 4th time I've spent too much time on hard problems
**Prevention strategy**: Set strict time limits and stick to them
**Practice needed**: Better time management, more practice with modular arithmetic
**Confidence level**: Low (wasn't sure about the approach)

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Error Prevention Strategies

### Careless Error Prevention
- **Double-check arithmetic**: Always verify calculations
- **Read carefully**: Take time to understand the problem
- **Use verification**: Plug back answers, check units
- **Slow down**: Don't rush through problems
- **Stay focused**: Avoid distractions during practice

### Conceptual Error Prevention
- **Master fundamentals**: Ensure strong foundation in all topics
- **Practice recognition**: Work on identifying problem types
- **Study solutions**: Learn from correct approaches
- **Build connections**: Understand how topics relate
- **Seek help**: Ask questions when confused

### Strategic Error Prevention
- **Time management**: Practice with strict time limits
- **Problem selection**: Learn when to skip problems
- **Guessing strategy**: Master expected value calculations
- **Verification**: Always check your work
- **Stay calm**: Don't let pressure affect decisions
