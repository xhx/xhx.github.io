# üìä Postmortem Framework

Use this systematic framework to analyze your full test performance, identify trends, and develop targeted improvement strategies. Regular postmortem analysis is essential for continuous improvement.

## üéØ Postmortem Process

### Immediate Analysis (Within 24 hours)
- **Score calculation**: Calculate your score and percentile
- **Problem-by-problem review**: Analyze each problem individually
- **Error identification**: Identify all mistakes and their causes
- **Time analysis**: Review time spent on each problem
- **Strategy evaluation**: Assess your overall approach

### Deep Analysis (Within 48 hours)
- **Pattern identification**: Look for recurring themes
- **Strengths assessment**: Identify what worked well
- **Weaknesses analysis**: Identify areas for improvement
- **Strategy refinement**: Adjust your approach
- **Action planning**: Develop specific improvement strategies

## üìã Postmortem Checklist

### Test Performance
- [ ] **Score**: What was your final score?
- [ ] **Percentile**: What percentile did you achieve?
- [ ] **Target comparison**: How does this compare to your target?
- [ ] **Previous performance**: How does this compare to past tests?
- [ ] **Overall assessment**: How do you feel about your performance?

### Problem-by-Problem Analysis
- [ ] **Problems 1-10**: How many did you get correct?
- [ ] **Problems 11-15**: How many did you get correct?
- [ ] **Problems 16-20**: How many did you get correct?
- [ ] **Problems 21-25**: How many did you get correct?
- [ ] **Accuracy by difficulty**: What's your accuracy by difficulty level?

### Error Analysis
- [ ] **Total errors**: How many problems did you get wrong?
- [ ] **Error types**: What types of errors did you make?
- [ ] **Error patterns**: Are there recurring error types?
- [ ] **Error distribution**: Where did most errors occur?
- [ ] **Error causes**: What caused these errors?

### Time Analysis
- [ ] **Total time**: How much time did you spend overall?
- [ ] **Time per problem**: What was your average time per problem?
- [ ] **Time distribution**: How did you allocate time across problems?
- [ ] **Time pressure**: Did you feel rushed at any point?
- [ ] **Time management**: How well did you manage your time?

## üîç Detailed Analysis Framework

### Problem-by-Problem Review

#### For Each Problem:
- **Problem number**: Which problem was it?
- **Difficulty level**: Easy (1-10), Medium (11-20), Hard (21-25)
- **Topic**: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Counting/Probability, Precalculus
- **Your approach**: What method did you use?
- **Time spent**: How long did you spend on this problem?
- **Result**: Correct, incorrect, or skipped
- **Error type**: If incorrect, what type of error?
- **Correct solution**: What was the correct approach?
- **Lessons learned**: What can you learn from this problem?

#### Example Problem Analysis:
**Problem #15 (Medium, Algebra)**
- **Your approach**: Used substitution method
- **Time spent**: 4 minutes
- **Result**: Incorrect
- **Error type**: Calculation mistake in final step
- **Correct solution**: Should have used elimination method
- **Lessons learned**: Try different approaches when stuck, double-check arithmetic

### Error Pattern Analysis

#### Error Categories:
- **Careless errors**: Calculation mistakes, reading errors, bubbling errors
- **Conceptual errors**: Misunderstanding, wrong approach, missing knowledge
- **Strategic errors**: Time management, guessing strategy, problem selection

#### Pattern Identification:
- **Most common error type**: What error type occurs most frequently?
- **Error distribution**: Where do most errors occur (by difficulty, topic)?
- **Error timing**: When do errors typically occur (beginning, middle, end)?
- **Error causes**: What are the root causes of your errors?

### Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

#### Strengths Assessment:
- **Strong topics**: Which topics do you perform well on?
- **Strong problem types**: Which problem types do you handle well?
- **Effective strategies**: Which strategies work well for you?
- **Time management**: How well do you manage your time?
- **Verification**: How well do you check your work?

#### Weaknesses Analysis:
- **Weak topics**: Which topics need improvement?
- **Weak problem types**: Which problem types are challenging?
- **Ineffective strategies**: Which strategies don't work well?
- **Time management**: Where do you struggle with time?
- **Verification**: Where do you need to improve checking?

## üéØ Improvement Planning

### Priority Setting
- **Top 3 weaknesses**: Identify your biggest improvement areas
- **Quick wins**: Identify areas where you can improve quickly
- **Long-term goals**: Identify areas requiring sustained effort
- **Resource allocation**: How will you allocate your study time?

### Action Plan Development
- **Specific goals**: Set concrete, measurable goals
- **Study plan**: Develop specific study strategies
- **Practice plan**: Create targeted practice routines
- **Timeline**: Set realistic timelines for improvement
- **Progress tracking**: Establish metrics for monitoring progress

### Example Action Plan:
**Weakness**: Poor time management on hard problems
**Goal**: Reduce time spent on problems 21-25 by 50%
**Strategy**: Set strict 5-minute time limits, practice with timer
**Practice plan**: 30 minutes daily of timed practice on hard problems
**Timeline**: 4 weeks to see improvement
**Progress tracking**: Track time spent on hard problems weekly

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Weekly Reviews
- **Error log analysis**: Review error patterns from past week
- **Practice performance**: Assess improvement in practice
- **Strategy effectiveness**: Evaluate which strategies are working
- **Goal progress**: Track progress toward specific goals
- **Adjustments**: Modify approach based on results

### Monthly Reviews
- **Overall progress**: Assess improvement over the month
- **Goal achievement**: Evaluate progress toward monthly goals
- **Strategy refinement**: Adjust strategies based on results
- **New challenges**: Identify emerging areas for improvement
- **Next month planning**: Develop next month's strategy
