<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>Using sum formula: $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55$.</p>

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #12, first pass. Should take 30 seconds. Area = length √ó width = 8 √ó 6 = 48.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>Area = length √ó width = 8 √ó 6 = 48 square units.</p>

What is the value of $\sqrt{144}$?

A) $10$  
B) $11$  
C) $12$  
D) $13$  
E) $14$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #15, first pass. Should take 30 seconds. $\sqrt{144} = 12$ since $12^2 = 144$.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>Since $12^2 = 144$, we have $\sqrt{144} = 12$.</p>
</details>

### Problem 5
*Tags: Second Pass ¬∑ source: AMC10 2020 #18*

A function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$. What is $f(3)$?

A) $16$  
B) $17$  
C) $18$  
D) $19$  
E) $20$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #18, second pass. Should take 1-2 minutes. $f(3) = 3^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Substituting $x = 3$: $f(3) = 3^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.</p>
</details>

### Problem 6
*Tags: Second Pass ¬∑ source: AMC10 2020 #20*

You're stuck on a problem with 5 answer choices. You can eliminate 2 choices. Should you guess or skip?

A) Guess  
B) Skip  
C) Need more information  
D) Both have same expected value  
E) Cannot be determined

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #20, second pass. Should take 1 minute. 3 choices remaining: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Since $2 > 1.5$, guess.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>With 3 remaining choices: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Since $2 > 1.5$, guess.</p>
</details>

### Problem 7
*Tags: Second Pass ¬∑ source: AMC10 2020 #22*

You have 10 minutes left and are on problem 22. What should you do?

B) Try to eliminate some choices, then guess  
C) Skip problem 22 and move on  
D) Go back to check previous answers  
E) Need more information

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #22, second pass. With 10 minutes left, try to eliminate some choices first, then guess. This maximizes expected value.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>With 10 minutes left and on problem 22, try to eliminate some choices first, then guess. This maximizes expected value while managing time.</p>
</details>

### Problem 8
*Tags: Second Pass ¬∑ source: AMC10 2020 #24*

You're stuck on a problem with 5 answer choices. You can eliminate 1 choice. Should you guess or skip?

A) Guess  
B) Skip  
C) Need more information  
D) Both have same expected value  
E) Cannot be determined

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #24, second pass. Should take 1 minute. 4 choices remaining: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Both have same expected value.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>With 4 remaining choices: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Both have same expected value.</p>
</details>

### Problem 9
*Tags: Third Pass ¬∑ source: AMC10 2020 #25*

You have 5 minutes left and 2 problems remaining. You can eliminate 1 choice on each. What should you do?

B) Guess on both problems  
C) Try to solve 1, guess on 1  
D) Skip both problems  
E) Need more information

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Problem #25, third pass. With 5 minutes left and 2 problems, guess on both. With 1 elimination each: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ points per problem, which equals the blank value.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>With 5 minutes left and 2 problems, guess on both. With 1 elimination each, guessing gives the same expected value as skipping, but guessing gives you a chance to get points.</p>
</details>
