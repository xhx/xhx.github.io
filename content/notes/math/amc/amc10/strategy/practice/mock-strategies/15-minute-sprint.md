<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 30 seconds</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Using order of operations: $3 + 4 \times 5 = 3 + 20 = 23$.</p>
</details>

A) $45$  
B) $50$  
C) $55$  
D) $60$  
E) $65$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Quick Triage:</strong> Problem #4, manageable. Formula: $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55$.</p>
<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 45 seconds</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>Using sum formula: $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55$.</p>
</details>

### Problem 3
*Tags: Sprint · source: AMC10 2020 #6*

A rectangle has length 8 and width 6. What is its area?

A) $14$  
B) $24$  
C) $28$  
D) $48$  
E) $64$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Quick Triage:</strong> Problem #6, straightforward. Area = length × width = 8 × 6 = 48.</p>
<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 30 seconds</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>Area = length × width = 8 × 6 = 48 square units.</p>
</details>

### Problem 4
*Tags: Sprint · source: AMC10 2020 #8*

What is the remainder when $2^{10}$ is divided by 7?

A) $1$  
B) $2$  
C) $3$  
D) $4$  
E) $5$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Quick Triage:</strong> Problem #8, manageable. Use modular arithmetic: $2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, so $2^{10} = 2^{3 \cdot 3 + 1} \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.</p>
<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 1 minute</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>Since $2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, we have $2^{10} = 2^{3 \cdot 3 + 1} \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.</p>
</details>

### Problem 5
*Tags: Sprint · source: AMC10 2020 #10*

A fair coin is flipped 3 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?

A) $\frac{1}{8}$  
B) $\frac{1}{4}$  
C) $\frac{3}{8}$  
D) $\frac{1}{2}$  
E) $\frac{3}{4}$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Quick Triage:</strong> Problem #10, manageable. There are $2^3 = 8$ total outcomes. Getting exactly 2 heads can happen in $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways: HHT, HTH, THH. So the probability is $\frac{3}{8}$.</p>
<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 1 minute</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>There are $2^3 = 8$ total outcomes. Getting exactly 2 heads can happen in $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways: HHT, HTH, THH. So the probability is $\frac{3}{8}$.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 30 seconds</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>
<p>With 1 minute left and 2 problems, guess on both. With 1 elimination each, guessing gives the same expected value as skipping, but guessing gives you a chance to get points.</p>
</details>

### Problem 11

A) $8$  
B) $9$  
C) $10$  
D) $11$  
E) $12$

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Quick Triage:</strong> Problem #24, strategic range. $2^{10} = 1024$, so $\log_2(1000) \approx 10$. Since $1000 < 1024$, the answer is slightly less than 10.</p>
<p><strong>Time Target:</strong> 1 minute</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>Since $2^{10} = 1024$ and $1000 < 1024$, we have $\log_2(1000) \approx 10$.</p>
