# ðŸŽ² Guessing vs. Skipping

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Value Framework

**AMC Scoring:** Correct = 6 points, Wrong = 0 points, Blank = 1.5 points

**Formula:** $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{1}{k-e} \cdot 6 + \frac{k-e-1}{k-e} \cdot 0 = \frac{6}{k-e}$

**Decision Rule:** Guess if $\text{EV}_\text{guess} > 1.5$ â†’ $k-e < 4$ â†’ $e > k-4$

## ðŸ§  Practice Problems

### Problem 1
*Tags: Expected Value Â· source: AMC10 2020 #20*

You're stuck on a problem with 5 answer choices. You can eliminate 2 choices. Should you guess or skip?

A) Guess  
B) Skip  
C) Need more information  
D) Both have same expected value  
E) Cannot be determined

<details><summary>Strategic Analysis</summary>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> 3 choices remaining. $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Since $2 > 1.5$, guess.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Value:</strong> 1 choice remaining, EV = 6 points.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer & Solution</summary>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>With 3 remaining choices: $\text{EV}_\text{guess} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$ vs. $\text{EV}_\text{blank} = 1.5$. Since $2 > 1.5$, guess.</p>

B) Skip  
C) Need more information  
D) Both have same expected value  
E) Cannot be determined
