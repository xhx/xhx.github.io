# ⚡ During Test Quick Checks

Perform these essential 20-second micro-checks before bubbling any answer to prevent careless errors and maintain high accuracy throughout the contest.

## 🎯 The 20-Second Verification Rule

### Before Bubbling Any Answer:
- [ ] **Plug back**: Substitute answer into original problem
- [ ] **Check units**: Do the units and dimensions make sense?
- [ ] **Verify constraints**: Does answer satisfy all given conditions?
- [ ] **Test extremes**: Does answer work at boundary values?
- [ ] **Check reasonableness**: Is the answer in the right ballpark?

## 🔍 Quick Verification Techniques

### Plug-Back Check (5 seconds)
- [ ] **Substitute answer**: Replace variable with your answer
- [ ] **Simplify**: Work through the calculation
- [ ] **Check equality**: Does left side equal right side?
- [ ] **Verify all conditions**: Check all given constraints
- [ ] **Confirm**: Answer satisfies the problem

### Units & Dimensions Check (3 seconds)
- [ ] **Length**: Should be positive, reasonable scale
- [ ] **Area**: Should be positive, units squared
- [ ] **Volume**: Should be positive, units cubed
- [ ] **Probability**: Must be between 0 and 1
- [ ] **Time**: Should be positive, reasonable duration

### Constraint Verification (5 seconds)
- [ ] **Domain restrictions**: Does answer satisfy domain?
- [ ] **Range restrictions**: Does answer satisfy range?
- [ ] **Inequality constraints**: Does answer satisfy inequalities?
- [ ] **Integer constraints**: Is answer integer if required?
- [ ] **Positive constraints**: Is answer positive if required?

### Extreme Value Check (4 seconds)
- [ ] **Boundary cases**: Test at limits and extremes
- [ ] **Special values**: Test $x = 0, 1, -1$ if applicable
- [ ] **Large values**: Test with large numbers
- [ ] **Small values**: Test with small numbers
- [ ] **Zero cases**: Test when variables equal zero

### Reasonableness Check (3 seconds)
- [ ] **Order of magnitude**: Is answer too big or too small?
- [ ] **Physical sense**: Does answer make physical sense?
- [ ] **Mathematical sense**: Does answer make mathematical sense?
- [ ] **Comparison**: How does it compare to other answers?
- [ ] **Intuition**: Does it feel right?

## ⚡ Problem-Specific Checks

### Algebra Problems
- [ ] **Substitute back**: Plug answer into original equation
- [ ] **Check all solutions**: Verify each root if multiple
- [ ] **Test constraints**: Check domain restrictions
- [ ] **Verify signs**: Check positive/negative requirements
- [ ] **Check calculations**: Verify arithmetic

### Geometry Problems
- [ ] **Check dimensions**: Verify units and scale
- [ ] **Test angles**: Are angles reasonable?
- [ ] **Verify formulas**: Are you using the right formula?
- [ ] **Check coordinates**: Do coordinates make sense?
- [ ] **Test area/volume**: Are areas/volumes positive?

### Number Theory Problems
- [ ] **Check divisibility**: Verify divisibility rules
- [ ] **Test modular arithmetic**: Check mod calculations
- [ ] **Verify prime factors**: Check prime factorizations
- [ ] **Test digit properties**: Check digit sum rules
- [ ] **Check integer constraints**: Is answer integer?

### Counting/Probability Problems
- [ ] **Check range**: Probability between 0 and 1
- [ ] **Verify counts**: Are counts non-negative integers?
- [ ] **Test symmetry**: Check symmetric cases
- [ ] **Verify formulas**: Are you using the right formula?
- [ ] **Check calculations**: Verify arithmetic

## 🚨 Common Error Types

### Sign Errors
- [ ] **Positive/negative**: Is the sign correct?
- [ ] **Addition/subtraction**: Check your arithmetic
- [ ] **Multiplication/division**: Check your operations
- [ ] **Exponents**: Check positive/negative exponents
- [ ] **Square roots**: Check positive/negative roots

### Unit Errors
- [ ] **Length units**: Are units appropriate?
- [ ] **Area units**: Are units squared?
- [ ] **Volume units**: Are units cubed?
- [ ] **Time units**: Are units appropriate?
- [ ] **Angle units**: Degrees or radians?

### Calculation Errors
- [ ] **Arithmetic**: Check addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- [ ] **Order of operations**: Follow PEMDAS correctly
- [ ] **Fractions**: Check numerator and denominator
- [ ] **Decimals**: Check decimal places
- [ ] **Percentages**: Check percentage calculations

### Logic Errors
- [ ] **Problem understanding**: Did you understand the problem?
- [ ] **Method selection**: Did you choose the right approach?
- [ ] **Step sequence**: Are your steps in the right order?
- [ ] **Conclusion**: Does your conclusion follow from your work?
- [ ] **Answer format**: Is your answer in the right format?

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### 20-Second Checklist:
- [ ] **Plug back** (5 seconds)
- [ ] **Check units** (3 seconds)
- [ ] **Verify constraints** (5 seconds)
- [ ] **Test extremes** (4 seconds)
