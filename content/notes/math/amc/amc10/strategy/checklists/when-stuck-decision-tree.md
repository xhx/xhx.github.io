# 🌳 When Stuck Decision Tree

Follow this systematic decision tree when you encounter difficult problems. Don't waste time spinning your wheels - use this structured approach to find a solution or move on efficiently.

## 🎯 Initial Assessment (30 seconds)

### First, Ask Yourself:
- [ ] **How long have I been on this problem?** (If > 5 minutes, consider moving on)
- [ ] **Am I making progress?** (If no progress, try different approach)
- [ ] **Do I understand what's being asked?** (If not, re-read carefully)
- [ ] **Is this problem worth my time?** (Consider expected value)
- [ ] **What's my confidence level?** (Low confidence = try different approach)

### Quick Time Check:
- **Problems 1-10**: Don't spend more than 3 minutes
- **Problems 11-15**: Don't spend more than 5 minutes
- **Problems 16-20**: Don't spend more than 7 minutes
- **Problems 21-25**: Don't spend more than 10 minutes

## 🔄 Tactic Switching (1-2 minutes)

### If Current Approach Isn't Working:
- [ ] **Switch from algebra to geometry**: Try coordinate geometry or visual approach
- [ ] **Switch from geometry to algebra**: Try setting up equations
- [ ] **Switch from direct to indirect**: Try complement counting or working backwards
- [ ] **Switch from general to specific**: Try plugging in specific values
- [ ] **Switch from complex to simple**: Try a simpler approach

### Tactic Switching Examples:
- **Algebra problem**: Try backsolving with answer choices
- **Geometry problem**: Try coordinate geometry
- **Counting problem**: Try complement counting
- **Number theory problem**: Try modular arithmetic
- **Function problem**: Try graphing or specific values

## 🎯 Complement Approaches (1-2 minutes)

### When Direct Approach is Hard:
- [ ] **Count what you don't want**: Use complement counting
- [ ] **Work backwards**: Start from the answer and work back
- [ ] **Use "at least" logic**: Count "none" and subtract
- [ ] **Use "at most" logic**: Count "more than" and subtract
- [ ] **Use probability complements**: $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$

### Complement Examples:
- **"At least one"**: Count "none" and subtract from total
- **"At most one"**: Count "more than one" and subtract from total
- **"Not all"**: Count "all" and subtract from total
- **"Some but not all"**: Count "all" and "none", then subtract

## 🔍 Symmetry and Patterns (1-2 minutes)

### Look for Symmetry:
- [ ] **Geometric symmetry**: Use symmetric properties
- [ ] **Algebraic symmetry**: Use symmetric substitutions
- [ ] **Combinatorial symmetry**: Use symmetric counting
- [ ] **Numerical symmetry**: Use symmetric patterns
- [ ] **Functional symmetry**: Use even/odd properties

### Pattern Recognition:
- [ ] **Look for cycles**: Find repeating patterns
- [ ] **Look for sequences**: Find arithmetic or geometric patterns
- [ ] **Look for formulas**: Find known formulas that apply
- [ ] **Look for identities**: Find trigonometric or algebraic identities
- [ ] **Look for special cases**: Find cases that are easier to handle

## 🔄 Backsolving and Answer Choice Exploitation (1-2 minutes)

### When Direct Solving is Hard:
- [ ] **Try answer choices**: Plug in each choice
- [ ] **Start with middle choice**: Often C or D
- [ ] **Use binary search**: Go higher or lower based on result
- [ ] **Eliminate obviously wrong**: Cross out impossible answers
- [ ] **Use answer choice patterns**: Look for patterns in choices

### Backsolving Process:
1. **Start with middle choice**: Try C or D
2. **Test the value**: Substitute into problem
3. **Compare result**: Does it match what's asked?
4. **Adjust direction**: Go higher or lower based on result
5. **Narrow down**: Use binary search approach

## 🎯 Coordinate and Visual Approaches (1-2 minutes)

### When Abstract Approach is Hard:
- [ ] **Draw a diagram**: Visualize the problem
- [ ] **Use coordinate geometry**: Place in coordinate system
- [ ] **Use graphing**: Plot functions or relationships
- [ ] **Use visualization**: Create mental or physical models
- [ ] **Use symmetry**: Apply symmetric properties

### Visual Approach Examples:
- **Geometry problem**: Draw accurate diagram
- **Function problem**: Graph the function
- **Counting problem**: Use Venn diagrams or tree diagrams
- **Algebra problem**: Graph both sides of equation
- **Number theory problem**: Use number line or grid

## ⚡ Quick Approximation and Estimation (1 minute)

### When Exact Solution is Hard:
- [ ] **Use estimation**: Approximate the answer
- [ ] **Use bounds**: Find upper and lower bounds
- [ ] **Use order of magnitude**: Estimate the scale
- [ ] **Use special values**: Try $x = 0, 1, -1$
- [ ] **Use extreme cases**: Test boundary values

### Approximation Examples:
- **Large numbers**: Use scientific notation
- **Complex expressions**: Use approximation formulas
- **Geometric problems**: Use approximate values
- **Counting problems**: Use approximation techniques
- **Probability problems**: Use approximation methods

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols (30 seconds)

### When All Else Fails:
- [ ] **Make an educated guess**: Use elimination and intuition
- [ ] **Use expected value**: Apply guessing strategy
- [ ] **Move on**: Don't waste more time
- [ ] **Mark for later**: Come back if time permits
- [ ] **Stay calm**: Don't let one problem ruin your contest

### Guessing Strategy:
- **Eliminate obviously wrong**: Cross out impossible answers
- **Use partial information**: Apply what you know
- **Use symmetry**: Choose symmetric answer if applicable
- **Use intuition**: Go with your gut feeling
- **Use expected value**: Apply mathematical guessing strategy

## 📊 Decision Tree Summary

### Time-Based Decisions:
- **0-2 minutes**: Try different approach
- **2-5 minutes**: Try complement or symmetry
- **5-10 minutes**: Try backsolving or approximation
- **10+ minutes**: Make educated guess or move on

### Problem-Based Decisions:
- **Easy problems (1-10)**: Don't get stuck, move on quickly
- **Medium problems (11-15)**: Try 2-3 different approaches
- **Hard problems (16-20)**: Try 1-2 approaches, then guess
- **Very hard problems (21-25)**: Try 1 approach, then guess

### Confidence-Based Decisions:
- **High confidence**: Continue with current approach
- **Medium confidence**: Try different approach
- **Low confidence**: Try complement or backsolving
- **No confidence**: Make educated guess or move on

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### When Stuck Checklist:
- [ ] **How long?** (If > time limit, move on)
- [ ] **Making progress?** (If no, try different approach)
- [ ] **Understand problem?** (If not, re-read)
- [ ] **Worth my time?** (Consider expected value)
- [ ] **Confidence level?** (Low = try different approach)

### Recovery Actions:
- **Switch tactics**: Try different approach
- **Use complement**: Count what you don't want
- **Look for symmetry**: Use symmetric properties
- **Try backsolving**: Use answer choices
- **Use approximation**: Estimate the answer
- **Make educated guess**: Use elimination and intuition
