# ðŸŽ² Counting & Probability Tactics

Master the essential counting and probability techniques that will help you solve problems involving arrangements, combinations, and likelihood calculations efficiently.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Counting Strategies

### Complement Counting
- **Count what you don't want**: Subtract from total
- **Use when direct counting is hard**: Often easier than direct approach
- **Apply to probability**: $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$
- **Use for "at least" problems**: Count "none" and subtract

### Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE)
- **Two sets**: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
- **Three sets**: $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$
- **General formula**: Alternating sum of intersections
- **Use for overlapping sets**: When sets have common elements

### Indicator Variables
- **Define indicator**: $I_A = 1$ if event A occurs, 0 otherwise
- **Expected value**: $E[I_A] = P(A)$
- **Linearity of expectation**: $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$
- **Use for counting**: Count occurrences of events

## ðŸ”„ Complement Counting Mastery

### When to Use Complement
- **"At least" problems**: Count "none" and subtract
- **"At most" problems**: Count "more than" and subtract
- **Complex direct counting**: When direct approach is difficult
- **Probability problems**: $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$

### Complement Process
1. **Identify what you want**: What are you counting?
2. **Identify what you don't want**: What's the complement?
3. **Count the complement**: Use direct counting
4. **Subtract from total**: Total - complement
5. **Check answer**: Verify the result

### Complement Example
**Problem**: How many ways can 5 people sit in a row if A and B cannot sit together?

**Solution**:
- Total arrangements: $5! = 120$
- Arrangements with A and B together: Treat A and B as one unit
- A and B together: $4! \cdot 2! = 24 \cdot 2 = 48$ (4 units, A and B can switch)
- Arrangements with A and B apart: $120 - 48 = 72$

### Complement Probability Example
**Problem**: What's the probability of getting at least one head in 3 coin flips?

**Solution**:
- $P(\text{at least one head}) = 1 - P(\text{no heads})$
- $P(\text{no heads}) = P(\text{all tails}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$
- $P(\text{at least one head}) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$

## âš¡ Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion

### Two-Set PIE
**Formula**: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

**When to use**: Two overlapping sets

**Process**:
1. **Count set A**: Find $|A|$
2. **Count set B**: Find $|B|$
3. **Count intersection**: Find $|A \cap B|$
4. **Apply formula**: $|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
5. **Check answer**: Verify the result

### Two-Set PIE Example
**Problem**: In a class of 30 students, 18 like math and 15 like science. If 8 like both, how many like at least one?

**Solution**:
- $|A| = 18$ (math), $|B| = 15$ (science), $|A \cap B| = 8$ (both)
- $|A \cup B| = 18 + 15 - 8 = 25$
- **Answer**: 25 students like at least one subject

### Three-Set PIE
**Formula**: $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$

**When to use**: Three overlapping sets

**Process**:
1. **Count individual sets**: Find $|A|, |B|, |C|$
2. **Count pairwise intersections**: Find $|A \cap B|, |A \cap C|, |B \cap C|$
3. **Count triple intersection**: Find $|A \cap B \cap C|$
4. **Apply formula**: Use the three-set formula
5. **Check answer**: Verify the result

## ðŸŽ¯ Indicator Variable Techniques

### Defining Indicators
**Indicator variable**: $I_A = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if event A occurs} \\ 0 & \text{if event A does not occur} \end{cases}$

**Properties**:
- $E[I_A] = P(A)$
- $E[I_A^2] = P(A)$ (since $I_A^2 = I_A$)
- $E[I_A I_B] = P(A \cap B)$

### Linearity of Expectation
**Formula**: $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$ for any random variables X and Y

**Applications**:
- **Counting problems**: Count occurrences of events
- **Probability problems**: Find expected values
- **Complex problems**: Break into simpler parts

### Indicator Example
**Problem**: What's the expected number of heads in 5 coin flips?

**Solution**:
- Let $X_i = 1$ if flip $i$ is heads, 0 otherwise
- $E[X_i] = P(\text{heads}) = \frac{1}{2}$ for each $i$
- $E[\text{total heads}] = E[X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_5] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + \cdots + E[X_5] = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2.5$

## ðŸ”¢ Symmetry Techniques

### When to Use Symmetry
- **Symmetric problems**: When problem has symmetric structure
- **Equal probability**: When outcomes are equally likely
- **Geometric problems**: When shapes are symmetric
- **Combinatorial problems**: When arrangements are symmetric

### Symmetry Process
1. **Identify symmetry**: Look for symmetric structure
2. **Use symmetric properties**: Apply symmetry principles
3. **Count symmetric cases**: Count one case and multiply
4. **Check answer**: Verify the result

### Symmetry Example
**Problem**: How many ways can 4 people sit around a circular table?

**Solution**:
- Total arrangements: $4! = 24$
- But rotations are the same: $4$ rotations
- Distinct arrangements: $\frac{24}{4} = 6$
- **Answer**: 6 ways

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Counting Techniques

### Generating Functions
**For counting**: Use power series to count combinations
**For probability**: Use generating functions for distributions
**For recurrence**: Use generating functions to solve recurrences

### Recurrence Relations
**Define recurrence**: Express current term in terms of previous terms
**Solve recurrence**: Find closed form or use generating functions
**Apply to counting**: Use recurrences to count arrangements

### Catalan Numbers
**Definition**: $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$
**Applications**: Binary trees, parentheses, paths
**Recurrence**: $C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i C_{n-1-i}$

## âš¡ Quick Counting Tricks

### Permutations
**Formula**: $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
**When to use**: Order matters, no repetition
**Examples**: Arrangements, rankings, passwords

### Combinations
**Formula**: $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
**When to use**: Order doesn't matter, no repetition
**Examples**: Committees, teams, subsets

### Permutations with Repetition
**Formula**: $n^r$
**When to use**: Order matters, repetition allowed
**Examples**: Passwords, license plates

### Combinations with Repetition
**Formula**: $\binom{n+r-1}{r}$
**When to use**: Order doesn't matter, repetition allowed
**Examples**: Distributing identical objects

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem-Specific Strategies

### Arrangement Problems
- **Use permutations**: When order matters
- **Use combinations**: When order doesn't matter
- **Use complement**: When direct counting is hard
- **Use symmetry**: When problem is symmetric

### Probability Problems
- **Use complement**: $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$

- **Use symmetry**: When outcomes are equally likely

### Counting Problems
- **Use direct counting**: When straightforward
