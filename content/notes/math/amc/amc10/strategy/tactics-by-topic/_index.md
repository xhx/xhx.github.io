# üß≠ Tactics by Topic

Master specialized problem-solving techniques for each major mathematical topic. These tactics provide targeted approaches for specific types of problems you'll encounter in AMC 10/12 contests.

## üéØ Topic-Specific Strategies

### üî¢ Algebra Tactics
- **[Algebra Tactics](algebra-tactics)** - Substitutions, discriminants, conjugates, and algebraic manipulation techniques
- **Key focus**: Equations, functions, inequalities, and algebraic relationships

### üî¢ Number Theory Tactics  
- **[Number Theory Tactics](number-theory-tactics)** - Modular arithmetic, divisibility, prime factorization, and number properties
- **Key focus**: Divisibility, remainders, primes, and number patterns

### üìê Geometry Tactics
- **[Geometry Tactics](geometry-tactics)** - Similar triangles, power of a point, coordinate geometry, and geometric relationships
- **Key focus**: Shapes, angles, areas, and spatial relationships

### üé≤ Counting & Probability Tactics
- **[Counting & Probability Tactics](counting-probability-tactics)** - Combinatorics, probability calculations, and counting techniques
- **Key focus**: Arrangements, combinations, and likelihood calculations

### üìä Precalculus Tactics (AMC 12)
- **[Precalculus Tactics](precalculus-tactics)** - Trigonometry, logarithms, and advanced function techniques
- **Key focus**: Trig identities, log properties, and function analysis

## üéØ How to Use These Tactics

### Problem-Solving Process
1. **Identify the topic**: Use topic routing heuristics
2. **Select appropriate tactics**: Choose from topic-specific techniques
3. **Apply systematically**: Follow the tactical approach
4. **Verify your answer**: Use sanity checks and verification

### Cross-Topic Integration
- **Many problems combine topics**: Don't limit yourself to one approach
- **Use multiple tactics**: Apply different techniques as needed
- **Stay flexible**: Adapt your approach based on what works
- **Learn connections**: Understand how topics relate

## üìä Topic Distribution

### AMC 10/12 Typical Distribution
- **Algebra**: 30-40% of problems
- **Geometry**: 25-35% of problems  
- **Number Theory**: 15-25% of problems
- **Counting/Probability**: 15-25% of problems
- **Precalculus**: 10-20% of problems (AMC 12 only)

### Strategic Focus
- **Master all topics**: Don't neglect any area
- **Identify strengths**: Focus on your strong topics
- **Improve weaknesses**: Work on challenging areas
- **Practice integration**: Solve problems that combine topics

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Topic Identification:
- **Algebra**: Variables, equations, functions
- **Number Theory**: Divisibility, remainders, primes
- **Geometry**: Shapes, angles, coordinates
- **Counting/Probability**: Arrangements, combinations
- **Precalculus**: Trig, logs, advanced functions

### Tactical Approach:
- **Read the problem**: Understand what's being asked
- **Identify the topic**: Use signal words and patterns
- **Select tactics**: Choose appropriate techniques
- **Apply systematically**: Follow the tactical approach
- **Verify answer**: Check your work
