# ðŸŽ² Probability & EV Snippets

Master essential probability and expected value calculations through quick practice snippets. These focused exercises will build speed and accuracy in probability problems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Probability Concepts

### Basic Probability
- **Definition**: $P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$
- **Range**: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- **Complement**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
- **Union**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- **Intersection**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ (if independent)

### Conditional Probability
- **Definition**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
- **Multiplication rule**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B)$
- **Bayes' theorem**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$

### Independence
- **Definition**: Events A and B are independent if $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$
- **Equivalent**: $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or $P(B|A) = P(B)$
- **Multiple events**: $P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n) = P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot P(A_n)$

## âš¡ Expected Value Mastery

### Basic Expected Value
- **Definition**: $E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X = x)$
- **Linearity**: $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$
- **Constants**: $E[cX] = c \cdot E[X]$
- **Independence**: $E[XY] = E[X] \cdot E[Y]$ (if independent)

### Indicator Variables
- **Definition**: $I_A = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if event A occurs} \\ 0 & \text{if event A does not occur} \end{cases}$
- **Properties**: $E[I_A] = P(A)$, $E[I_A^2] = P(A)$, $E[I_A I_B] = P(A \cap B)$
- **Applications**: Counting problems, probability calculations

### Common Distributions
- **Uniform**: $P(X = k) = \frac{1}{n}$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$
- **Bernoulli**: $P(X = 1) = p$, $P(X = 0) = 1-p$, $E[X] = p$
- **Binomial**: $P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$, $E[X] = np$
- **Geometric**: $P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$, $E[X] = \frac{1}{p}$

## ðŸ”¢ Advanced Probability Techniques

### Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
- **Two events**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- **Three events**: $P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)$
- **General formula**: Alternating sum of intersections

### Complementary Counting
- **"At least" problems**: $P(\text{at least one}) = 1 - P(\text{none})$
- **"At most" problems**: $P(\text{at most one}) = 1 - P(\text{more than one})$
- **"Not all" problems**: $P(\text{not all}) = 1 - P(\text{all})$

### Symmetry
- **Equal probability**: When outcomes are equally likely
- **Symmetric problems**: When problem has symmetric structure
- **Geometric problems**: When shapes are symmetric
- **Combinatorial problems**: When arrangements are symmetric
