- [ ] **Problems 11-15**: Complete with good accuracy (80%+)
- [ ] **Time per problem**: 2-3 minutes average
- [ ] **Build confidence**: Each success builds momentum
- [ ] **Stay focused**: One problem at a time
- [ ] **Check time**: Monitor progress at 15, 30, 45 minutes

### Second Pass: Strategic (25 minutes)
- [ ] **Problems 16-20**: Strategic approach with good accuracy
- [ ] **Problems 21-25**: Selective approach, use eliminations
- [ ] **Time per problem**: 2-4 minutes based on difficulty
- [ ] **Guessing strategy**: Apply expected value calculations
- [ ] **Stay flexible**: Adapt approach as needed
- [ ] **Check time**: Monitor progress at 60, 70 minutes

### Final Review: Completion (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Bubble audit**: Ensure all answers are marked
- [ ] **Quick verification**: Spot-check calculations
- [ ] **Final guesses**: Apply expected value to remaining blanks
- [ ] **Student ID check**: Verify your ID is correct
- [ ] **Answer sheet review**: Final check for completeness
- [ ] **Submit**: End the simulation

## üìä Post-Simulation Analysis

### Immediate Analysis (Within 1 hour)
- [ ] **Score calculation**: Calculate your score and percentile
- [ ] **Problem-by-problem review**: Analyze each problem
- [ ] **Error identification**: Identify all mistakes
- [ ] **Time analysis**: Review time spent on each problem
- [ ] **Strategy evaluation**: Assess your overall approach

### Detailed Analysis (Within 24 hours)
- [ ] **Pattern identification**: Look for recurring themes
- [ ] **Strengths assessment**: Identify what worked well
- [ ] **Weaknesses analysis**: Identify areas for improvement
- [ ] **Strategy refinement**: Adjust your approach
- [ ] **Action planning**: Develop specific improvement strategies

## üéØ Simulation Strategies

### Time Management
- **Checkpoint system**: Set time checkpoints at 15, 30, 45, 60, 70 minutes
- **Problem allocation**: Allocate time based on difficulty
- **Flexibility**: Adjust approach based on progress
- **Emergency protocol**: Know what to do when behind schedule
- **Final review**: Always leave time for final review

### Problem Approach
- **First pass**: Focus on problems 1-15
- **Second pass**: Strategic approach to problems 16-25
