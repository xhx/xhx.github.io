# üéØ Answer Choice Exploitation Playbook

Transform multiple choice from a constraint into an advantage. Learn to use answer choices strategically to solve problems more efficiently.

## üîÑ Backsolving Strategy

### When to Backsolve
- **Algebraic equations**: When solving for a variable
- **Word problems**: When answer represents a quantity
- **Verification**: When you have a candidate answer
- **Time pressure**: When direct solving is taking too long

### Backsolving Process
1. **Start with middle choice**: Often C or D
2. **Test the value**: Substitute into problem
3. **Compare result**: Does it match what's asked?
4. **Adjust direction**: Go higher or lower based on result
5. **Narrow down**: Use binary search approach

### Backsolving Example
**Problem**: Find $x$ such that $2x + 3 = 11$

**Answer choices**: A) 2, B) 3, C) 4, D) 5, E) 6

**Process**:
- Try C) 4: $2(4) + 3 = 11$ ‚úì **Correct!**

## üìè Bounding Techniques

### Upper and Lower Bounds
- **Find reasonable range**: Eliminate extreme values
- **Test boundary cases**: Check limits and extremes
- **Use inequalities**: Apply known inequalities
- **Monotonicity**: Use increasing/decreasing properties

### Bounding Strategies
1. **Identify the range**: What's the reasonable domain?
2. **Test extremes**: Check boundary values
3. **Use properties**: Apply known inequalities
4. **Narrow down**: Eliminate impossible ranges

### Bounding Example
**Problem**: Find the maximum value of $f(x) = x(4-x)$ for $0 \leq x \leq 4$

**Answer choices**: A) 2, B) 3, C) 4, D) 5, E) 6

**Bounding**:
- $f(0) = 0$ and $f(4) = 0$
- Maximum occurs at $x = 2$: $f(2) = 2(2) = 4$
- **Answer: C) 4**

## üìà Monotonicity Checks

### Increasing Functions
- **Larger input ‚Üí larger output**: $f(a) < f(b)$ when $a < b$
- **Test two values**: Compare function values
- **Use derivatives**: If applicable
- **Apply properties**: Use known monotonicity

### Decreasing Functions
- **Larger input ‚Üí smaller output**: $f(a) > f(b)$ when $a < b$
- **Test two values**: Compare function values
- **Use derivatives**: If applicable
- **Apply properties**: Use known monotonicity

### Monotonicity Example
**Problem**: Which is larger: $2^{100}$ or $3^{75}$?

**Answer choices**: A) $2^{100}$, B) $3^{75}$, C) Equal, D) Cannot determine

**Monotonicity check**:
- $2^{100} = (2^4)^{25} = 16^{25}$
- $3^{75} = (3^3)^{25} = 27^{25}$
- Since $16 < 27$ and both have same exponent, $2^{100} < 3^{75}$
- **Answer: B) $3^{75}$**

## üîç Plug-and-Chunk Strategy

### When to Use
- **Complex expressions**: When direct evaluation is hard
- **Multiple variables**: When you need to test combinations
- **Verification**: When you want to double-check
- **Time pressure**: When you need a quick answer

### Process
1. **Identify key values**: Find important test points
2. **Plug systematically**: Test each choice
3. **Look for patterns**: Notice relationships
4. **Eliminate systematically**: Cross out wrong answers

### Plug-and-Chunk Example
**Problem**: Find the value of $\frac{a+b}{a-b}$ when $a = 3$ and $b = 1$

**Answer choices**: A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4, E) 5

**Plugging**:
- $\frac{3+1}{3-1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$
- **Answer: B) 2**

## üéØ Answer Choice Patterns

### Common Patterns
- **Arithmetic sequences**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Geometric sequences**: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
- **Powers**: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 (squares)
- **Factorials**: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120
- **Powers of 2**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

### Pattern Recognition
- **Look for sequences**: Identify the pattern
- **Test the pattern**: Verify it works
- **Apply the pattern**: Use it to solve
- **Check consistency**: Ensure it makes sense

## üßÆ Dimensional Analysis

### Units and Dimensions
- **Check units**: Do the units make sense?
- **Verify dimensions**: Are the dimensions correct?
- **Test extreme cases**: What happens at limits?
- **Apply physical intuition**: Does it feel right?

### Dimensional Example
**Problem**: Find the area of a circle with radius 3

**Answer choices**: A) $3\pi$, B) $6\pi$, C) $9\pi$, D) $12\pi$, E) $18\pi$

**Dimensional analysis**:
- Area should have units of length squared
- $A = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 3^2 = 9\pi$
- **Answer: C) $9\pi$**

## ‚ö° Quick Choice Elimination

### Obvious Eliminations
- **Negative answers**: When answer should be positive
- **Zero answers**: When answer should be non-zero
- **Extreme values**: When answer should be reasonable
- **Wrong units**: When units don't match

### Systematic Elimination
1. **Check units first**: Eliminate dimensionally wrong answers
2. **Test boundary cases**: Eliminate extreme values
3. **Apply constraints**: Use problem constraints
4. **Use symmetry**: Apply symmetric properties

## üéØ Advanced Techniques

### Working Backwards
- **Start with answer**: Assume answer is correct
- **Work backwards**: Derive what must be true
- **Check consistency**: Does it make sense?
- **Verify solution**: Does it solve the problem?

### Partial Information
- **Use what you know**: Apply known facts
- **Eliminate impossibilities**: Cross out wrong answers
- **Make educated guesses**: Use partial information
- **Check consistency**: Ensure logical consistency

## üö® Common Mistakes

### Avoid These Traps:
- **Rushing**: Don't skip verification steps
- **Confirmation bias**: Don't just look for answers you like
- **Over-complicating**: Don't make it harder than necessary
- **Ignoring units**: Always check units and dimensions

### Red Flags:
- **All answers seem wrong**: You made an error
- **Multiple answers work**: Check your work
- **Answer doesn't make sense**: Verify your approach
- **Units don't match**: Check your calculations
