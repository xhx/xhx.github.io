# 🏁 Endgame Management Playbook

Master the final minutes of the contest to maximize your score through strategic decision-making, efficient completion, and smart risk management.

## ⏰ Final 10 Minutes Protocol

### Time Allocation
- **Minutes 65-70**: Complete in-progress problems
- **Minutes 70-72**: Quick scan for easy completions
- **Minutes 72-75**: Bubble audit and final decisions
- **Minute 75**: Contest ends

### Priority Order
1. **Finish started problems**: Complete what you've begun
2. **Quick wins**: Look for easy problems you skipped
3. **Strategic guessing**: Apply expected value to remaining blanks
4. **Bubble verification**: Ensure all answers are marked

## 🎯 Selective Completion Strategy

### Complete These Problems
- **Problems 1-15**: Always complete if started
- **Problems 16-20**: Complete if you have a clear approach
- **Problems 21-25**: Only if you're confident and have time

### Skip These Problems
- **Problems 21-25**: If you're stuck and time is running out
- **Complex problems**: If they require too much time
- **Unfamiliar topics**: If you don't know the approach
- **Time sinks**: If they're taking too long

### Decision Framework
- **Can I solve this in 2 minutes?** → Complete
- **Do I have a clear approach?** → Complete
- **Am I making progress?** → Continue
- **Am I stuck?** → Skip and move on

## 🎲 Strategic Guessing Protocol

### Expected Value Thresholds
- **2+ eliminations**: Always guess (EV > 1.5)
- **1 elimination**: Only if confident (EV = 1.5)
- **0 eliminations**: Skip (EV < 1.5)

### Guessing Priority
1. **Problems 16-20**: Medium difficulty, good EV
2. **Problems 21-25**: Hard difficulty, but high EV if eliminations
3. **Problems 1-15**: Only if you're absolutely sure

### Quick Elimination
- **Units/dimensions**: Eliminate dimensionally wrong answers
- **Order of magnitude**: Eliminate extreme values
- **Parity**: Check even/odd properties
- **Boundary cases**: Test extreme values
