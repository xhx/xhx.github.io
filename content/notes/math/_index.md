# Mathematics Notes

Welcome to the mathematics section of my notes! Here you'll find organized mathematical content, research notes, and problem sets.

## Content

- [Self-Attention Methods](/notes/ai/ml/self-attention-approx/) - Deep learning attention mechanisms
- [LSH Attention](/notes/lsh-attention/) - Locality-sensitive hashing for attention
- [AMC Problems](/notes/amc/) - American Mathematics Competitions

## Mathematical Examples

This section uses KaTeX to render LaTeX mathematics beautifully. For instance, here's Einstein's famous equation: $E=mc^2$.

Or for a displayed equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Mathematical Notation

You can use various mathematical symbols:

- **Greek letters**: $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$
- **Calculus**: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$
- **Linear algebra**: $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$
- **Statistics**: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$

Feel free to explore the mathematical content and let me know if you have any questions!
